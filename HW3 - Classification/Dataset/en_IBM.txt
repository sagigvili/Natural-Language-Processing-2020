== History ==
IBM was founded in 1911 in Endicott , New York , as the Company ( CTR ) and was renamed International Business Machines in 1924 .
IBM is incorporated in New York and has operations in over 170 the 1880s technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines ( IBM ) .
Julius Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885 ; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder ( 1888 ) ; Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine ; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889 .
On June 16 , 1911 , their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company , the Company ( CTR ) based in Endicott , New York .
The five companies had employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton , New York ; Dayton , Ohio ; Detroit , Michigan ; Washington , ; and manufactured machinery for sale and lease , ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders , meat and cheese slicers , to tabulators and punched cards .
Thomas Watson , , fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson , called on Flint and , in 1914 , was offered a position at CTR .
Watson joined CTR as General Manager then , 11 months later , was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved .
Having learned Patterson pioneering business practices , Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR companies .
He implemented sales conventions , generous sales incentives , a focus on customer service , an insistence on , salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker .
His favorite slogan , THINK , became a mantra for each company employees .
During Watson first four years , revenues reached 9 million ( 133 million today ) and the company operations expanded to Europe , South America , Asia and Australia .
Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name Company and on February 14 , 1924 , chose to replace it with the more expansive title International Business Machines .
By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company , IBM .
In 1937 IBM tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process huge amounts of data .
Its clients included the Government , during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the Social Security Act , and Hitler Third Reich , for the tracking of Jews and other persecuted groups , largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag .
The social business gave an 81 increase in revenue from 1935 to 1949 Thomas Watson , , created IBM World Trade Corporation , a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations .
In 1952 he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm , and his son Thomas Watson , was named president .
IBM built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator , an electromechanical computer , during World War II .
It offered its first commercial stored program computer , the vacuum tube based IBM 701 , in 1952 .
The IBM 305 RAMAC introduced the hard disk drive in 1956 .
The company switched to transistorized designs with the 7000 and 1400 series , beginning in 1958 .
In 1956 the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur Samuel of IBM Poughkeepsie , New York , laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but learn from its own experience .

On April 7 , 1964 , IBM announced the first computer system family , the IBM .
It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small , allowing companies to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications .
It was followed by the IBM in 1970 .
Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s .
In 1969 the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the electronic digital computer system market , specifically computers designed primarily for business , and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM actions directed against leasing companies and peripheral manufacturers .
Shortly after , IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit , creating a competitive market for software .
In 1982 the Department of Justice dropped the case as without Also in 1969 , IBM engineer Forrest Parry invented the magnetic stripe card that would become ubiquitous for cards , driver licenses , rapid transit cards , and a multitude of other identity and access control applications .
IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards , and for most of the 1970s , the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers .
In 1974 IBM engineer George Laurer developed the Universal Product Code .
IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement .
The IBM PC , originally designated IBM 5150 , was introduced in 1981 , and it soon became an industry standard .
In 1991 IBM spun out its printer manufacturing into a new business called Lexmark .

Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around .
In 2002 IBM acquired PwC consulting , and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values , hosting a online discussion of key business issues with employees .
The result was three values : Dedication to every client success , Innovation that our company and for the world , and Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships .
In 2005 the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo and , in 2009 , it acquired software company SPSS Later in 2009 , IBM Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President Barack Obama .
In 2011 , IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson , which was exhibited on Jeopardy
where it won against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter .
The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary in the same year on June 16 .
In 2012 IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa and Texas Memory Systems , and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies , a web hosting service , in a deal worth around 2 billion .

IBM future focus will be on cloud computing and artificial intelligence , built on the foundation of the 2019 Red Hat acquisition .
The new company NewCo , yet to be formally named , created from IBM Global Technology Services Managed Infrastructure Services unit , will have employees , clients in 115 countries , with a backlog of 60 billion .
IBM spin off will be greater than any of its previous divestitures , and welcomed by has regularly reinvented itself by selling off low margin assets while shifting its focus to , more profitable markets .
