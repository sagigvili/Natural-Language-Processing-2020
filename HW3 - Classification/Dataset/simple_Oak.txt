The oak tree is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus .
There are about 600 living species .
The common name oak ( Oaks ) may also appear in the names of species in related genera , such as Lithocarpus .
The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere .
It includes deciduous and evergreen species from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in Asia and the Americas .
North America has the largest number of oak species : about 90 occur in the United States .
Mexico has 160 species , of which 109 are endemic .
The second greatest center of oak diversity is China , which has about 100 have spirally arranged leaves , with rounded edges in many species ; some have leaves with jagged edges or entire leaves with smooth margins .
Many deciduous species do not drop dead leaves until spring .
In spring , a single oak tree produces both male flowers ( as catkins ) and small female flowers .
The fruit is a nut called an acorn , carried in a structure .
Each acorn has one seed ( rarely two or three ) and takes months to mature , depending on species .
The live oaks are evergreen .
They are not a taxonomic group , just a life style which occurs across the genus .
The oak is a kind of hardwood forest tree .
They are well known as a climax vegetation in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere .
That means , left untouched by humans , it would be the dominant tree .
Much of England was covered by oak forests before modern farming took over the land .
The last extensive oak woodlands were cut down to build ships for the Royal Navy in the 18th century .
Some kinds of oak wood are very hard .
That is why people in past centuries cut them down to make ships , furniture and other things .
The wood is now scarce and expensive and only used to make a few things anymore .
Much cheaper are softwoods like pine .
Oak trees grow slowly and can live up to 1000 years .
== Associated animals ==
A mature oak tree stands about 100 feet tall ( metres ) .
It is a home for more animals than any other European tree .
30 species of birds , 45 different bugs and over 200 species of moth have been found on oaks .
Beetles burrow under the bark , and some drill holes into the wood .
The leaves are eaten by many caterpillars .
Many leaves carry strange little bumps on the underside .
These are insect galls , caused by many little animals .
Midges , moths , worms and tiny wasps lay their eggs in leaves or leaf buds .
The leaf reacts by forming a growth around the eggs .
Inside the gall , larvae develop .
The leaf falls , but the larvae may come out only the next spring .
Small galls only have one larva , but larger galls may contain as many as 30 larvae .
== Acorns ==
Oak trees produce acorns once a year which ripen in autumn .
Oak trees may start producing acorns when they are about 20 years old .
A mature oak may produce acorns a year ; this is several millions in its lifetime .
