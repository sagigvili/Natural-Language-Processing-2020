== Products and services ==
TomTom as a company offers three types of products in different shapes and forms : maps , connected services and ( navigation ) software .
TomTom Navigation devices ( PNDs ) and TomTom GO navigation apps are sold directly or indirectly to .
systems are released for the automotive market .
The navigation devices and portable devices with installed software are referred to as partners with several car manufacturers and offers navigation devices .
=== Navigation ===
TomTom units provide a flying interface with an oblique view of the road , as well as a map view .
They use a GPS receiver to show the precise location and provide visual and spoken directions on how to drive to the specified destination .
Some TomTom systems also integrate with mobile phones using Bluetooth , traffic congestion maps or to actually take calls and read SMS messages aloud .
Navigation devices TomTom GPS navigation devices come with a touch screen , speaker , USB port , internal Lithium ion battery .
Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a smartphone , allows the device to be used as a speakerphone to make and receive handsfree calls .
TomTom Go , Via and Start general purpose navigation devices .
TomTom Camper Caravan RV these models have a map that is supplied with height and width restrictions , which allows vehicle size and weight data to be entered for the route planning .
TomTom Truck designed for professional truck drivers and include software and maps .
TomTom Rider Portable models for motorcycle and motorscooter users .
They differ from other devices in that the Rider is partly shielded and has a screen and GUI .
TomTom One and One XL The TomTom One is the base model for automobile navigation .
The difference between the TomTom One XL and the TomTom One is the size of the touch screen ( vs in or 110 vs 89 mm ) .
Neither model of the One contains the added functions included in the Go models , such as Bluetooth calling and MP3 Jukebox .
However , the One is able to receive traffic and weather updates using the TomTom Plus service when paired via Bluetooth with a mobile phone with a DUN data service .
The reduced software capability means less demand on the hardware , which allows the One to be sold at a significantly lower price than the Go .
The XL is also available as a Live version with integrated Live Services .
Navigation software TomTom Navigator a GPS navigation software product for personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , Palm devices , Pocket PCs , and some smartphones .
TomTom Navigator 6 replaced the earlier TomTom Mobile .

TomTom for iOS GPS navigation software product for iOS devices , originally announced for the iPhone at the Apple WWDC Keynote speech in early June 2009 , and released internationally on 15 August 2009 in the Apple App Store , with various map packs for different regions .
TomTom Vice President of Marketing Development gave information in an interview by Macworld in July 2009 .
Currently the app works with iPhone ( all models ) , the iPod Touch ( all models ) and the iPad ( all models ) , however Apple dropped the support for the early models and latest versions of the TomTom iOS app might have issues on certain devices .
There are two separate TomTom car kits available for certain Apple devices .
The current maps available in each countries app stores varies according to language availability of the app itself , the country of the app store , and thus differing region group map packs are available .
Turkey and Greece were not included in the larger Europe map pack ; this is related to the AppStore app size limitation of 2 GB .
These maps are available separately .
Iceland is not available in any map package sold by TomTom at the moment , but they are working on it ( and a few other countries too ) .
Also most likely there will be a new iOS app available , based on the NavKit , which might cure the issue with the size limit ( also Apple increased the app size limit to 4 GB ) .
TomTom Go Mobile , GPS navigation software for the Android operating system .
It replaced the old app , which had similar features to the iOS app .
In March 2015 , TomTom announced the new TomTom Go Mobile app for Android with a freemium subscription model for maps with the first 50 kilometres per month being free , including all the maps that are available , TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras .
The previous app , which had promised free lifetime updates , is not available for purchase on Play Store anymore and its maps are not updated since October 2015 .
TomTom claims their definition of lifetime map updates is the period of time that TomTom continues to support the app with updates .
Previous customers of TomTom Android navigation app are offered a discount on the subscription in the new app for three years .
There is no provision for users who want to keep using the old app under the conditions it was sold with lifetime map updates .
TomTom Speed Cameras , a mobile software application released in 2015 free of software for several mobile phones was discontinued after release ; Navigator , which does not support all the phones that Mobile did , is the nearest equivalent .
Mobile can not use maps later than build 1223 ; this and earlier program versions are not compatible with all map versions , particularly other builds of version 6 .
In September 2012 , Apple collaborated with TomTom to provide mapping data for its revamped iOS 6 updated Apple Maps app .
The partnership was in part due to Apple decision to wean itself off the products of its competitor , Google .
As of 2018 TomTom continues to provide data for Apple Maps .
=== Support Applications ===
TomTom Home ( stylized as TomTom HOME ) is a PC application that allows to be sent to the mobile device .
TomTom Home version and above is implemented on the XULRunner platform .
With version , TomTom Home added a platform where users can download and upload content to personalize their device such as voices , images , POI sets , etc .
At the moment TomTom Home is on version .
Despite being based on the XULRunner , TomTom Home lacks support for Linux .
It is , for instance , impossible to update the maps in these devices by connecting them to another machine running Linux , even when using a common web browser like Firefox that normally allowed such an update under Microsoft Windows .
However , the devices can still be read in a Linux OS as a disk drive .
There is even software made by the community to manage some functions of the NAV3 and NAV4 range of models use MyDrive Connect .
MyDrive Connect is compatible with 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows preview and with most Mac OS X versions .
The internal flash memory or the memory card content of the device can not be accessed through USB for security reasons ( modified applications would easily accept a map that was sold by TomTom ) .
The device can update itself by getting files through the HTTP protocol over USB .
The support app is nothing more than a proxy on the PC buffering the download .
So far the security achieved using this mechanism has not been broken yet .
Also , the usage of the file system brought stability improvements in device operations .
=== Traffic services ===
A traffic monitoring service that uses multiple sources to provide traffic information .
The service does this by combining data from : traditional sources : data such as induction loops in the roads , cameras and traffic surveillance new sources : traffic flow of millions of anonymous mobile phone usersThe information is merged by TomTom and algorithms are used to improve the data and filter out anomalous readings .
The system sends updates to all TomTom Traffic users every two minutes ( and the data the users receive is never older than 30 seconds ) .
Users can receive the service through the SIM , via a smartphone connection or on older devices via a standard phone connection .
can be set to be transparent to the user with the only sign that the route has been changed due to a traffic jam being a sound indication from the device and a changed ETA .
The system was first launched in the Netherlands in 2007 and expanded to the United Kingdom , France , Germany and Switzerland in 2008 .
By , TomTom Live services including TomTom Traffic were available in the United States , South Africa , New Zealand and seventeen European countries : Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom .
As of 2015 , the service is vastly expanded and current coverage is available on the TomTom Traffic site ( 34 countries as of 26 June 2015 and the list expands every few months to new regions ) .
HD Traffic ( August 2012 ) : More accurate location of traffic jams , improved coverage of automatically detected road closures TomTom Traffic ( September 2013 ) : Increased accuracy of jam location now allows for Ahead Warnings , warning drivers when approaching a too fast .
Improved coverage of automatic road closure detection started to include also major secondary roads .
Automatic road works detection on highways .
TomTom also added Flow Feed for better predicting approaching traffic delays , with the goal of improving optimal route calculation and ETA .
TomTom Traffic ( November 2014 ) : TomTom included weather information in their routing algorithms , and warns users in areas of bad weather .
Also , version now incorporates in their traffic information road closures that are reported via the online Map Share Reporter tool .
=== Consumer ===
The company offers services under the name TomTom Plus ( stylized TomTom PLUS ) , which include services to warn drivers about speed cameras , provide weather updates , change voices and provide traffic alerts .
Currently , the fees are only for European countries .
Traffic data is also available to subscribers in many parts of Europe and the US via a cell phone with Internet service or an aerial , which picks up RDS data ( broadcast on FM radio frequencies ) offering traffic information without the requirement for a data connection .
The TomTom Plus service is not compatible with Apple iPhone .
In October 2008 the company released Live Services on the Go 940 Live .
These allowed users to receive updates over the mobile telephone network using the SIM card in the device .
These services included HD Traffic , Safety Alerts , Local Search with Google and Fuel Prices .
On 12 May 2011 , TomTom announced that it was offering up its traffic products to industry partners in the United the latest NAV4 devices the service is not available anymore in the old form .
The included services had been separated and now being called TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras .
On the devices the traffic service is free of charge either via the SIM ( Always Connected models ) or via a compatible smartphone ( or BYOD ) .
The speed camera service is free for three months on these models .
However , there is a newer range , the models , which come now with free lifetime speed camera subscription too .
Map Share is a proprietary map technology launched by TomTom in June 2007 .
Map Share allows users to make changes to the maps on their navigation devices and share them with others .
It allows drivers to make changes to their maps directly on their navigation devices .
Drivers can block or unblock streets , change the direction of traffic , edit street names and add , edit or remove points of interest ( POIs ) .
Improvements can be shared with other users through TomTom Home , TomTom content management software .
An online version called Map Share Reporter is on the TomTom website .
IQ Routes , developed by TomTom and available since spring 2008 on the TomTom Go 730 and Go 930 , uses anonymous travel time data accumulated by users of TomTom satnav devices .
Newer TomTom devices use this data to take into account the time and day when determining the fastest time data is stored in Historical Speed Profiles , one for each road segment , covering large motorways , main roads and also small local roads .
Historic Speed Profiles are part of the digital map and are updated with every new map release .
They give insight into traffic patterns .
This is a routing system based on measured travel times , compared to most other methods which use speed limits or assumed speeds .
In September 2008 , map upgrade was released for x20 series models , extending the IQ Routes feature to those devices with a free software update using TomTom the NAV3 and NAV4 models the IQ Routes feature is available by default on all map versions .
== Mapping ==
TomTom products use Tele Atlas based maps .
Map errors are reported using the Tele Atlas Map Insight and the TomTom Map Share Reporter Tool ( preferred tool ) .
Reports can be done via the devices too .
These reports are processed and by TomTom staff members and the end products are synchronized via the TomTom support applications , such as TomTom Home for the NAV2 devices and MyDrive Connect for the NAV3 and NAV4 devices .
These support applications are available for Windows or Mac OS X based computers .
Maps are not universally compatible across TomTom devices ; while most maps are available for most modern devices , a compatible version must be used .
Version numbers have a number identifying the major version , a dot , then a build number .
Major version v940 , for example , is available for most regions and most devices , but different builds are available for different regions and devices and supporting different features .
The support applications ensure that the correct map version is assigned for download .
For NAV2 devices one has to purchase the map via the TomTom Home support application and for NAV3 and NAV4 devices , one has to obtain the updates via the TomTom webshop .
== Controversy ==
In April 2011 , TomTom apologized for supplying driving data collected from customers to police to use in catching speeding motorists .
The company had collected data from its Dutch customers which Dutch police subsequently used to set targeted speed traps .
As a result of this , TomTom was investigated by the Dutch Data Protection Authority , who found that TomTom had not contravened the Dutch Data Protection 2011 , TomTom improved the clarity of its explanation of how it uses the data it collects from its May 2011 , the company announced that it was planning to sell aggregated customer information to the Roads Traffic Authority of the Australian state of New South Wales , which could also potentially be used for targeted speed privacy implications of this announcement were widely reported , particularly the lack of anonymity and the potential to associate the data with individuals .
The company practice of selling its user data has been criticised by Electronic Frontiers Australia .
David Vaile of the University of New South Wales Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre has called for an independent technical analysis of the company data collection practices .
TomTom navigation devices collect user data that includes point of origin , point of destination , journey times , speeds and routes taken .
The Australian Privacy Foundation said it would be easy to trace the data back to individual customers , even if TomTom claimed it used only aggregated , anonymous VP of Marketing Chris Kearney insisted the information was totally anonymous .
In addition to this , he said TomTom never sold the information to Dutch authorities with speed cameras in mind , although Kearney would not rule out selling the user data for similar use in data is being purchased from various mapping companies by governments on a fairly regular basis .
It is not known if governments use this data for purposes other than the placement of speed cameras , such as to improve the road network , introduce traffic lights or find accident hotspots .
== Competition ==
TomTom main retail car sat nav competitors are MiTAC ( Navman and Magellan Navigation ) and main autonomous driving HD maps competitor is Here , which is owned by a consortium of German automotive companies ( namely Audi , BMW , and Daimler ) .
