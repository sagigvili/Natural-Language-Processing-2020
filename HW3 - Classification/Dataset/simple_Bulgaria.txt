== History ==
In what is now Bulgaria , many different people and different cultures lived over time .
This includes Neolithic , Hamangia culture , Vinƒça culture , eneolithic , Varna culture ( 5th millennium BC ) and the Bronze Age Ezero culture .
The Thracians lived in the area of modern Bulgaria .
King Tere united the people in Odrysian kingdom around 500 BC .
Alexander the Great had influence over the people on the 4th century and later by the Roman Empire during the time of Christ .
Eurasian Avars , South Slavs and Huns settled all over the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century .
The first Bulgarian empire was established in 681 AD .
The second Bulgarian empire started about 1185 AD , with Turnovo as the capital .
The Ottoman Empire took over in 1396 , and ruled Bulgaria for about 500 years .
The Ottomans had very strict rules and the Bulgarians suffered .
The Bulgarians rebelled several times against the Turkish rulers .
After the first Balkan war ( 1876 ) , Bulgaria pulled away from Ottoman Empire influence with the help of the Russian Empire who were already fighting the Ottomans .
But it was not until 1908 that the whole country of Bulgaria was united as modern Bulgaria .
Bulgaria joined the side of Germany in World War I and lost .
During the first year of World War II Bulgaria said it was neutral and refused to join sides with Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union .
But the increased tension in the war made the leaders sign the Tripartite Pact with Germany in March 1941 .
This let German forces go through Bulgaria to reach Greece .
However , Bulgaria did not follow Hitler wishes .
Bulgaria troops refused to participate in military coups and also refused to send Jews to concentration camps in the Holocaust .
This made Adolf Hitler very suspicious , and the king of Bulgaria , Tsar Boris III , died one day after talking to Hitler .
In 1944 when it became clear that the Allied Powers would win the war , Bulgaria had to find another solution .
Their leaders declared that they withdrew from the Axis forces and they let the Soviets come in .
But the Soviet Union did respect Bulgaria wish to be neutral .
They replaced the royal monarchy with Communism in 1947 before they withdrew from Bulgaria .
For 40 years , under their leader Todor Zhivkov , Bulgaria was very close to the Soviet Union and followed their instructions .
Shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall , on November 10 1989 , the Communist party gave up their rule and allowed the country to elect leaders of their own choice .
But in a few years Bulgaria had serious money problems under the new socialist government .
Since that time Bulgaria has recovered in many ways , and is much more stable .
But it is still one of the poorest countries in Europe .
Problems in the administration , a weak court system and organized crime are the biggest issues for Bulgaria .
== Economy and Social Welfare ==
Bulgaria economy was dependent on the COMECON market .
This was a group of communist countries ( Soviet Union , Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Poland , and Romania ) that agreed to work together .
This group fell apart in 1989 with the fall of communism in Europe .
While this was good for personal freedom , it was too much of a change for the businesses and jobs .
Also Yugoslavia , their neighbor , fell into a civil war as their country broke apart , and that did not help Bulgaria .
Living standards fell by 40 percent as people lost their jobs and their savings were not worth much , and even some newborn babies were sent to orphanages when their parents could not take care of them .
In 1994 Bulgaria had a short economic boom .
But that slowed down in 1996 from bad finance deals and other banking problems .
In 1997 there was high inflation ( the money could not buy as much as it did before ) .
Retired people had little income ( their pension did not go up as fast as inflation did ) and their savings were not worth very much .
Many retired people were begging in the streets for food .
But since then the economy has grown steadily .
People from outside the country started putting money into businesses and houses , and Bulgarians learned how to make their own businesses .
Today Bulgaria has Europe lowest income and corporate tax , 10 percent for both individuals and businesses .
This makes Bulgaria a very good place for business .
Bulgaria also has skilled and educated workers .
The average monthly salary in Bulgaria is still cheap at 400 euro or 541 state no longer has free health care .
This system has been replaced by an insurance plan that people pay for , and drug costs are based on income .
Private health care is encouraged nowadays .
Help for people who lose their jobs is no longer automatic , but some help is available , based on family status and length of retirement age for men is 64 years and for women 61 years .
It will be 63 years and 9 months for woman and 65 years and 3 months for man in 2032 .
