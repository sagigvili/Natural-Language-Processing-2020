A report in May 2011 on the Global Peace Index , found that if the world had been 25 more peaceful in the previous year , the global economy would have had an additional 2 trillion .
This amount would have covered 2 of the GDP per year required to avoid the worst effects of global warming , cover all costs to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , cancel the public debt held by Greece , Ireland and Portugal , and cover the rebuilding costs for the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and religions believe in world peace .
The League of Nations and the United Nations were created to make world peace .
Many theorists , however , believe that humans were born to be violent and preventing it would not be possible because it is nature .
Others have said that criminals do not believe in peace and will continue to commit crimes .
