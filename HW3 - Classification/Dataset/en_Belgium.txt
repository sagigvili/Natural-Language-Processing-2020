Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium , is a country in Western Europe .
It is bordered by the Netherlands to the north , Germany to the east , Luxembourg to the southeast , France to the southwest , and the North Sea to the northwest .
It covers an area of km2 ( sq mi ) and has a population of more than million , making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe , with a density of 376 per square kilometre ( mi ) .
The capital and largest city is Brussels ; other major cities are Antwerp , Ghent , Charleroi , Liège , Bruges , Namur , and Leuven .
Legally , Belgium is a sovereign state and a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system .
Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds .
It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : Flanders in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Region .
Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita .
Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians .
A small Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons .
The Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language .
Belgium linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments .
Historically , Belgium is part of an area known as the Low Countries , a somewhat larger region than the current Benelux group of states that also included parts of northern France and western Germany .
Its modern name is derived from the Latin word Belgium , used in Julius Caesar Gallic Wars , to describe the region in the period around 55 BCE .
From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century , the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan center of commerce and culture .
Between the 16th and early 19th centuries , Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers , earning the moniker the Battlefield of Europe , a reputation strengthened by both world wars .
The country emerged in 1830 following the Belgian Revolution , when it seceded from the Netherlands .
Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution and , during the course of the 20th century , possessed a number of colonies in Africa .
The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the and the citizens fueled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia .
This continuing antagonism has led to several reforms , resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993 .
Despite the reforms , tensions between the groups have remained , if not increased ; there is significant separatism particularly among the Flemish ; controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities ; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election , a world record .
Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders , which boomed after the is one of the six founding countries of the European Union and its capital , Brussels , hosts the official seats of the European Commission , the Council of the European Union , and the European Council , as well as one of two seats of the European Parliament ( the other being Strasbourg ) .
Belgium is also a founding member of the Eurozone , NATO , OECD , and WTO , and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the Schengen Area .
Brussels hosts the headquarters of many major international organizations such as is a developed country , with an advanced economy .
It has very high standards of living , quality of life , healthcare , education , and is categorized as very high in the Human Development Index .
It also ranks as one of the safest or most peaceful countries in the world .
== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
The Belgae were the inhabitants of the northernmost part of Gaul , which was significantly bigger than modern Belgium .
Caesar used the word Belgium once , to refer to their region .
Gallia Belgica , as it was more commonly called , became a Roman province as a result of his conquests .
Areas closer to the Rhine frontier , including the eastern part of modern Belgium , eventually became part of the province of Germania Inferior , which interacted with Germanic tribes outside the empire .
At the time when central government collapsed in the Western Roman Empire , both these provinces were inhabited by a mix of Frankish tribes and a more Romanized population .
=== Middle Ages ===
During the 5th century the area came under the rule of the Frankish Merovingian kings , who were probably first established in what is northern France .
During the 8th century the kingdom of the Franks evolved and became the Carolingian Empire .
The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the Carolingian empire into three kingdoms , whose borders had a lasting impact on medieval political boundaries .
Most of modern Belgium was in the Middle Kingdom , later known as Lotharingia .
Only the coastal county of Flanders became part of West Francia , the predecessor of France .
In 870 in the Treaty of Meerssen , modern Belgium lands all became part of the western kingdom , and in 880 in the Treaty of Ribemont , Lotharingia came under the lasting control of the Holy Roman Emperor , but the lordships and bishoprics along the March ( frontier ) between the two great kingdoms maintained important connections between each other .
In the 13th and 14th the cloth industry and commerce boomed in the County of Flanders and it became one of the richest areas in Europe .
This prosperity played a role in conflicts between Flanders and the king of France which most famously involved the Battle of the Golden Spurs .
=== Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands ===
Many of these fiefdoms were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries .
The union gave the area economic and political stability which led to an even greater prosperity and artistic creation .
Emperor Charles V , heir of the Burgundians , but also of the royal families of Austria , Castile and Aragon ( House of Trastámara ) , was born in Belgium extended the personal union of the Seventeen Provinces in the 1540s , making it far more than a personal union by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 and increased his influence over the of Liège .
=== Spanish and Austrian Netherlands ===
The Eighty Years War divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces ( Belgica Foederata in Latin , the Federated Netherlands ) and the Southern Netherlands ( Belgica Regia , the Royal Netherlands ) .
The latter were ruled successively by the Spanish ( Spanish Netherlands ) and the Austrian Habsburgs ( Austrian Netherlands ) and comprised most of modern Belgium .
This was the theatre of several more protracted conflicts during much of the 17th and 18th centuries involving France , including the War , the Nine Years War , the War of the Spanish Succession , and part of the War of the Austrian Succession .
Following the campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars , the Low territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule , such as the of annexed by the French First Republic , ending Austrian rule in the region .
The reunification of the Low Countries as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the First French Empire in 1814 , after the abdication of Napoleon .
=== Independent Belgium ===
In 1830 , the Belgian Revolution led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois , officially and neutral , independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress .
Since the installation of Leopold I as king on 21 July 1831 , now celebrated as Belgium National Day , Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , with a laicist constitution based on the Napoleonic code .
Although the franchise was initially restricted , universal suffrage for men was introduced after the general strike of 1893 ( with plural voting until 1919 ) and for women in 1949 .
The main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party , with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the 19th century .
French was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie .
It progressively lost its overall importance as Dutch became recognized as well .
This recognition became official in 1898 , and in 1967 , the parliament accepted a Dutch version of the Berlin Conference of 1885 ceded control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II as his private possession .
From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold II , for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production .
Many Congolese were killed by Leopold agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber .
In 1908 , this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony , henceforth called the Belgian Congo .
A Belgian commission in 1919 estimated that Congo population was half what it was in 1879 .
Germany invaded Belgium in August 1914 as part of the Schlieffen Plan to attack France , and much of the Western Front fighting of World War I occurred in western parts of the country .
The opening months of the war were known as the Rape of Belgium due to German excesses .
Belgium assumed control of the German colonies of ( Rwanda and Burundi ) during the war , and in 1924 the League of Nations mandated them to Belgium .
In the aftermath of the First World War , Belgium annexed the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy in 1925 , thereby causing the presence of a minority .
German forces again invaded the country in May 1940 , and Belgians , over half of them Jews , were killed during the subsequent occupation and The Holocaust .
From September 1944 to February 1945 the Allies liberated Belgium .
After World War II , a general strike forced King Leopold III to abdicate in 1951 , since many Belgians felt he had collaborated with Germany during the war .
The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 during the Congo Crisis ; followed with its independence two years later .
Belgium joined NATO as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg .
Belgium became one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and of the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community , established in 1957 .
The latter has now become the European Union , for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions , including the European Commission , the Council of the European Union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the European Parliament .
== Geography ==
Belgium shares borders with France ( 620 km ) , Germany ( 167 km ) , Luxembourg ( 148 km ) and the Netherlands ( 450 km ) .
Its total surface , including water area , is km2 ( sq mi ) .
Before 2018 , its total area was believed to be km2 ( sq mi ) .
However , when the country statistics were measured in 2018 , a new calculation method was used .
Unlike previous calculations , this one included the area from the coast to the line , revealing the country to be 160 km2 ( 62 sq mi ) larger in surface area than previously thought .
Its land area alone is km2 .
It lies between latitudes and N , and longitudes and Belgium has three main geographical regions ; the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the Basin , and the Ardennes uplands in the southeast to the Hercynian orogenic belt .
The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium southernmost tip , Belgian coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders .
Further inland lies a smooth , slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways , with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine ( Kempen ) .
The thickly forested hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges .
Extending westward into France , this area is eastwardly connected to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau , on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country highest point at 694 m ( ft ) .
The climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons ( Köppen climate classification : Cfb ) , like most of northwest Europe .
The average temperature is lowest in January at 3 and highest in July at 18 .
The average precipitation per month varies between 54 mm ( in ) for February and April , to 78 mm ( in ) for July .
Averages for the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of 7 and maximums of 14 and monthly rainfall of 74 mm ( in ) ; these are about 1 and nearly 10 millimetres above last century normal values , , Belgium is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom .
According to the World Wide Fund for Nature , the territory of Belgium belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests .
=== Provinces ===
The territory of Belgium is divided into three Regions , two of which , the Flemish Region and Walloon Region , are in turn subdivided into provinces ; the third Region , the Brussels Capital Region , is neither a province nor a part of a province .
== Politics ==
Belgium is a constitutional , popular monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy .
The bicameral federal parliament is composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Representatives .
The former is made up of 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions and 10 senators .
Prior to 2014 , most of the Senate members were directly elected .
The Chamber 150 representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from 11 electoral districts .
Belgium has compulsory voting and thus maintains one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the King ( currently Philippe ) is the head of state , though with limited prerogatives .
He appoints ministers , including a Prime Minister , that have the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives to form the federal government .
The Council of Ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members .
With the possible exception of the Prime Minister , the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of members and members .
The judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the Napoleonic code .
The Court of Cassation is the court of last resort , with the courts of appeal one level below .
=== Political culture ===
Belgium political institutions are complex ; most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities .
Since about 1970 , the significant national Belgian political parties have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities .
The major parties in each community , though close to the political center , belong to three main groups : Christian Democrats , Liberals , and Social Democrats .
Further notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century , mainly around linguistic , nationalist , or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature .
A string of Christian Democrat coalition governments from 1958 was broken in 1999 after the first dioxin crisis , a major food contamination scandal .
A rainbow coalition emerged from six parties : the Flemish and the Liberals , Social Democrats and Greens .
Later , a purple coalition of Liberals and Social Democrats formed after the Greens lost most of their seats in the 2003 government led by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget , some tax reforms , a reform , scheduled nuclear and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution .
Restrictions on withholding euthanasia were reduced and marriage legalized .
The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa and opposed the invasion of Iraq .
It is the only country that does not have age restrictions on coalition fared badly in the June 2007 elections .
For more than a year , the country experienced a political crisis .
This crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible partition of Belgium .
From 21 December 2007 until 20 March 2008 the temporary Verhofstadt III Government was in office .
This coalition of the Flemish and Francophone Christian Democrats , the Flemish and Francophone Liberals together with the Francophone Social Democrats was an interim government until 20 March that day a new government , led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme , the actual winner of the federal elections of June 2007 , was sworn in by the king .
On 15 July 2008 Leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king , as no progress in constitutional reforms had been made .
In December 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a crisis surrounding the sale of Fortis to BNP Paribas .
At this juncture , his resignation was accepted and Christian Democratic and Flemish Herman Van Rompuy was sworn in as Prime Minister on 30 December Herman Van Rompuy was designated the first permanent President of the European Council on 19 November 2009 , he offered the resignation of his government to King Albert II on 25 November 2009 .
A few hours later , the new government under Prime Minister Yves Leterme was sworn in .
On 22 April 2010 , Leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king after one of the coalition partners , the OpenVLD , withdrew from the government , and on 26 April 2010 King Albert officially accepted the Parliamentary elections in Belgium on 13 June 2010 saw the Flemish nationalist become the largest party in Flanders , and the Socialist Party PS the largest party in Wallonia .
Until December 2011 , Belgium was governed by Leterme caretaker government awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for formation of a new government .
By 30 March 2011 this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government , previously held by Iraq .
Finally , in December 2011 the Di Rupo Government led by Walloon socialist Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo was sworn in .
The 2014 federal election ( coinciding with the regional elections ) resulted in a further electoral gain for the Flemish nationalist , although the incumbent coalition ( composed of Flemish and Social Democrats , Liberals , and Christian Democrats ) maintains a solid majority in Parliament and in all electoral constituencies .
On 22 July 2014 , King Philippe nominated Charles Michel ( MR ) and Kris Peeters ( CD V ) to lead the formation of a new federal cabinet composed of the Flemish parties , CD V , Open Vld and the MR , which resulted in the Michel Government .
It is the first time is part of the federal cabinet , while the side is represented only by the MR , which achieved a minority of the public votes in Wallonia .
=== Communities and regions ===
Following a usage which can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburg courts , in the 19th century it was necessary to speak French to belong to the governing upper class , and those who could only speak Dutch were effectively citizens .
Late that century , and continuing into the 20th century , Flemish movements evolved to counter this the people in Southern Belgium spoke French or dialects of French , and most Brusselers adopted French as their first language , the Flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making Dutch an equal language in the education system .
Following World War II , Belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities .
Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimize the potential for on the four language areas defined in ( the Dutch , bilingual , French and German language areas ) , consecutive revisions of the country constitution in 1970 , 1980 , 1988 and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels : The federal government , based in Brussels .
The three language communities : the Flemish Community ; the French Community ; the Community .
The three regions : the Flemish Region , subdivided into five provinces ; the Walloon Region , subdivided into five provinces ; the constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities , as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters .
Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980 , Flemish politicians decided to merge both .
Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities : the territory of the Region ( which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions ) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities , and the territory of the Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region .
Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium .
The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully .
=== Locus of policy jurisdiction ===
The Federal State authority includes justice , defense , federal police , social security , nuclear energy , monetary policy and public debt , and other aspects of public finances .
companies include the Belgian Post Group and Belgian Railways .
The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO .
It controls substantial parts of public health , home affairs and foreign affairs .
The the by the federal government amounts to about 50 of the national fiscal income .
The federal government employs around 12 of the civil exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries , originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community language : culture ( including audiovisual media ) , education and the use of the relevant language .
Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy ( curative and preventive medicine ) and assistance to individuals ( protection of youth , social welfare , aid to families , immigrant assistance services , and so on .
) have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory .
These include economy , employment , agriculture , water policy , housing , public works , energy , transport , the environment , town and country planning , nature conservation , credit and foreign trade .
They supervise the provinces , municipalities and intercommunal utility several fields , the different levels each have their own say on specifics .
With education , for instance , the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications , which remain federal matters .
Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers .
The power of the Regions and Communities Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world .
=== Foreign relations ===
Because of its location at the crossroads of Western Europe , Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbors .
With virtually defenseless borders , Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation .
The Belgians have been strong advocates of European integration .
Both the European Union and NATO are headquartered in Belgium .
=== Armed forces ===
The Belgian Armed Forces have about active troops .
In 2019 , Belgium defense budget totaled billion ( billion ) representing of its GDP .
They are organized into one unified structure which consists of four main components : Land Component , or the Army ; Air Component , or the Air Force ; Marine Component , or the Navy ; Medical Component .
The operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the Staff Department for Operations and Training of the Ministry of Defense , which is headed by the Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training , and to the Chief of effects of the Second World War made collective security a priority for Belgian foreign policy .
In March 1948 Belgium signed the Treaty of Brussels and then joined NATO in 1948 .
However , the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the Korean War .
The Belgians , along with the Luxembourg government , sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the Belgian United Nations Command .
This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions which the Belgians supported .
Currently , the Belgian Marine Component is working closely together with the Dutch Navy under the command of the Admiral Benelux .
== Economy ==
Belgium strongly globalized economy and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of Europe .
Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world 15th largest trading nation in 2007 .
The economy is characterized by a highly productive work force , high GNP and high exports per capita .
Belgium main imports are raw materials , machinery and equipment , chemicals , raw diamonds , pharmaceuticals , foodstuffs , transportation equipment , and oil products .
Its main exports are machinery and equipment , chemicals , finished diamonds , metals and metal products , and Belgian economy is heavily and shows a dual nature : a dynamic Flemish economy and a Walloon economy that lags behind .
One of the founding members of the European Union , Belgium strongly supports an open economy and the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate member economies .
Since 1922 , through the Economic Union , Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union .
Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the Industrial Revolution , in the early 19th century .
Liège and Charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking , which flourished until the century in the Sambre and Meuse valley and made Belgium one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910 .
However , by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis , and the region experienced famine from 1846 to World War II , Ghent and Antwerp experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries .
The 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession ; it was particularly prolonged in Wallonia , where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced a serious decline .
In the 1980s and 1990s , the economic center of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond the end of the 1980s , Belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120 of GDP .
As of 2006 , the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to of GDP .
In 2005 and 2006 , real GDP growth rates of and , respectively , were slightly above the average for the Euro area .
Unemployment rates of in 2005 and in 2006 were close to the area average .
By October 2010 , this had grown to compared to an average rate of for the European Union as a whole ( EU 27 ) .
From 1832 until 2002 , Belgium currency was the Belgian franc .
Belgium switched to the euro in 2002 , with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999 .
The standard Belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch ( first King Albert II , since 2013 King Philippe ) .
Despite an 18 decrease observed from 1970 to 1999 , Belgium still had in 1999 the highest rail network density within the European Union with 000 km2 .
On the other hand , the same period , , has seen a huge growth of the motorway network .
In 1999 , the density of km motorways per 1000 km2 and 1000 inhabitants amounted to and respectively and were significantly superior to the EU means of and .
From a biological resource perspective , Belgium has a low endowment : Belgium biocapacity adds up to only global hectares in 2016 , just about half of the global hectares of biocapacity available per person worldwide .
In contrast , in 2016 , Belgians used on average global hectares of biocapacity - their ecological footprint of consumption .
This means they required about eight times as much biocapacity as Belgium contains .
As a result , Belgium was running a biocapacity deficit of global hectares per person in experiences some of the most congested traffic in Europe .
In 2010 , commuters to the cities of Brussels and Antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams .
Like in most small European countries , more than 80 of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport , the Brussels Airport .
The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge ( Bruges ) share more than 80 of Belgian maritime traffic , Antwerp being the second European harbor with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of over the preceding five years .
In 2016 , the port of Antwerp handled 214 million tons after a growth of is a large economic gap between Flanders and Wallonia .
Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders , mostly due to its heavy industries , but the decline of the steel industry War II led to the region rapid decline , whereas Flanders rose swiftly .
Since then , Flanders has been prosperous , among the wealthiest regions in Europe , whereas Wallonia has been languishing .
As of 2007 , the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders .
The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the language divide .
movements have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence .
The separatist New Flemish Alliance party , for instance , is the largest party in Belgium .
=== Science and technology ===
Contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the country history .
The 16th century Early Modern flourishing of Western Europe included cartographer Gerardus Mercator , anatomist Andreas Vesalius , herbalist Rembert Dodoens and mathematician Simon Stevin among the most influential Ernest Solvay and engineer Zenobe Gramme ( École industrielle de Liège ) gave their names to the Solvay process and the Gramme dynamo , respectively , in the 1860s .
Bakelite was developed in by Leo Baekeland .
Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the Solvay Institute of Sociology , the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the Université libre de Bruxelles .
In 1911 , he started a series of conferences , the Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry , which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry .
A major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a Belgian , Monsignor Georges Lemaître ( Catholic University of Louvain ) , who is credited with proposing the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe in Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Belgians : Jules Bordet ( Université libre de Bruxelles ) in 1919 , Corneille Heymans ( University of Ghent ) in 1938 and Albert Claude ( Université libre de Bruxelles ) together with Christian de Duve ( Université catholique de Louvain ) in 1974 .
François Englert ( Université libre de Bruxelles ) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 .
Ilya Prigogine ( Université libre de Bruxelles ) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 .
Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the Fields Medal : Pierre Deligne in 1978 and Jean Bourgain in 1994 .

of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized , as have of people of Moroccan background , of Italians , of the French and of Dutch people .
=== Languages ===
Belgium has three official languages : Dutch , French and German .
A number of minority languages are spoken as well .
As no census exists , there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium three official languages or their dialects .
However , various criteria , including the language ( s ) of parents , of education , or the status of foreign born , may provide suggested figures .
An estimated 60 of the Belgian population are native speakers of Dutch ( often referred to as Flemish ) , and 40 of the population speaks French natively .
Belgians are often referred to as Walloons , although the French speakers in Brussels are not total number of native Dutch speakers is estimated to be about million , concentrated in the northern Flanders region , while native French speakers number million in Wallonia and an estimated ( or 85 ) in the officially bilingual Region .
The Community is made up of people in the east of the Walloon Region ; around German and Belgian nationals are speakers of German .
Roughly more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Belgian Dutch and Belgian French have minor differences in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the Netherlands and France .
Many Flemish people still speak dialects of Dutch in their local environment .
Walloon , considered either as a dialect of French or a distinct Romance language , is now only understood and spoken occasionally , mostly by elderly people .
Walloon is divided into four dialects , which along with those of Picard , are rarely used in public life and have largely been replaced by French .
=== Religion ===
Since the country independence , Roman Catholicism has had an important role in Belgium politics .
However Belgium is largely a secular country as the constitution provides for freedom of religion , and the government generally respects this right in practice .
During the reigns of Albert I and Baudouin , the Belgian royal family had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium majority religion ; being especially strong in Flanders .
However , by 2009 Sunday church attendance was 5 for Belgium in total ; 3 in Brussels , and in Flanders .
Church attendance in 2009 in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in 1998 ( 11 for the total of Belgium in 1998 ) .
Despite the drop in church attendance , Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium to the Eurobarometer 2010 , 37 of Belgian citizens responded that they believe there is a God .
31 answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or .
