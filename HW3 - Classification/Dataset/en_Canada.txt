Canada is a country in the northern part of North America .
Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering million square kilometres ( million square miles ) , making it the world country by total area .
Its southern and western border with the United States , stretching kilometres ( mi ) , is the world longest land border .
Canada capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver .
Various Indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization .
Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast .
As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 .
In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces .
This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .
This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982 , which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British Parliament .
Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition , with a monarch and a prime minister who serves as the chair of the Cabinet and head of government .
The country is a realm within the Commonwealth of Nations , a member of the Francophonie and officially bilingual at the federal level .
It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency , civil liberties , quality of life , economic freedom , and education .
It is one of the world most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of immigration from many other countries .
Canada long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture .
As a highly developed country , Canada has the nominal income globally as well as the ranking in the Human Development Index .
Its advanced economy is the in the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and international trade networks .
Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations , NATO , the G7 , the Group of Ten , the G20 , the United Agreement and the Economic Cooperation forum .
== Etymology ==
While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada , the name is now accepted as coming from the Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata , meaning village or settlement .
In 1535 , Indigenous inhabitants of the Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona .
Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona ( the chief at Stadacona ) ; by 1545 , European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as the 16th to the early 18th century Canada referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River .
In 1791 , the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named the Canadas ; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841 .
Upon Confederation in 1867 , Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference , and the word Dominion was conferred as the country title .
By the 1950s , the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom , which considered Canada a Realm of the Commonwealth .
The government of Louis Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1982 , the passage of the Canada Act , bringing the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control , referred only to Canada , while later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day .
The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces , though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion .
== History ==
=== Indigenous peoples ===
Indigenous peoples in Canada include the First Nations , Inuit , and Métis , the last being a people who originated in the century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity .
The term Aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents , including the Constitution Act , first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least years ago .
The archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada .
The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements , agriculture , complex societal hierarchies , and trading networks .
Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between and two million , with a figure of accepted by Canada Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples .
As a consequence of European colonization , the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent , and several First Nations , such as the Beothuk , disappeared .
The decline is attributed to several causes , including the transfer of European diseases , such as influenza , measles , and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity , conflicts over the fur trade , conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers , and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations not without conflict , European Canadians early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful .
First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada , particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade .
The Crown and Indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period , though the Inuit , in general , had more limited interaction with European settlers .
However , from the late 18th century , European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture .
These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations .
A period of redress is underway , which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008 .
=== European colonization ===
It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson .
In approximately 1000 AD , the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland .
No further European exploration occurred until 1497 , when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England .
In 1534 , French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where , on July 24 , he planted a ( 33 ft ) cross bearing the words Long Live the King of France and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I .
The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast .
In general , early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been due to a combination of the harsh climate , problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in 1583 , Sir Humphrey Gilbert , by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I , founded John , Newfoundland , as the first North American English colony .
French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal ( in 1605 ) and Quebec City ( in 1608 ) .
Among the colonists of New France , Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the Maritimes , while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes , Hudson Bay , and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana .
The Beaver Wars broke out in the century over control of the North American fur English established additional settlements in Newfoundland , beginning in 1610 and the Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded soon after .
A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763 ; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years War .
Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years War .
=== British North America ===
The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights , created the Province of Quebec out of New France , and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia .
John Island ( now Prince Edward Island ) became a separate colony in 1769 .
To avert conflict in Quebec , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774 , expanding Quebec territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley .
More importantly , the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule .
It the French language , Catholic faith , and French civil law there , staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies .
The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies , further fuelling sentiment in the years prior to the American the successful American War of Independence , the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace , ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country .
The American war of independence also caused a large of Loyalists , the settlers who had fought against American independence .
Many moved to Canada , particularly Atlantic Canada , where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories .
New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes which led to the incorporation of Saint John , New Brunswick to become Canada first city .
To accommodate the influx of Loyalists in Central Canada , the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into Lower Canada ( later Quebec ) and Upper Canada ( later Ontario ) , granting each its own elected legislative Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom .
Peace came in 1815 ; no boundaries were changed .
Immigration resumed at a higher level , with over arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850 .
New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances .
Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837 .
The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture .
The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849 .
The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute , extending the border westward along the 49th parallel .
This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island ( 1849 ) and in British Columbia ( 1858 ) .
The Alaska Purchase of 1867 by the United States established the border along the Pacific coast , although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the and border for years to come .
=== Confederation and expansion ===
Following several constitutional conferences , the British North America Act 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1 , 1867 , initially with four provinces : Ontario , Quebec , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick .
Canada assumed control of Rupert Land and the Territory to form the Northwest Territories , where the Métis grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870 .
British Columbia and Vancouver Island ( which had been united in 1866 ) joined the confederation in 1871 , while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 .
In 1898 , during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories , parliament created the Yukon Territory .
Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905 .
Between 1871 and 1896 , almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated southwards , to the open the West and encourage European immigration , Parliament approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways ( including the Canadian Pacific Railway ) , opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act , and establishing the Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory .
This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to Indian reserves , clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements .
This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land .
The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands The federal government did provide emergency relief , on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves .
During this time , Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education , government and legal rights .
=== Early 20th century ===
Because Britain still maintained control of Canada foreign affairs under the British North America Act , 1867 , its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I .
Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps , which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war .
Out of approximately Canadians who served in World War I , some were killed and another were wounded .
The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet proposal to augment the military dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from Quebecers .
The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service , though it , coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec , deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party .
In 1919 , Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain , and the Statute of Westminster 1931 affirmed Canada independence .
The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn , leading to hardship across the country .
In response to the downturn , the Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state ( as pioneered by Tommy Douglas ) in the 1940s and 1950s .
On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , war with Germany was declared effective September 10 , 1939 , by King George VI , seven days after the United Kingdom .
The delay underscored Canada first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939 .
In all , over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during World War II and approximately were killed and another were wounded .
Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war , including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid , the Allied invasion of Italy , the Normandy landings , the Battle of Normandy , and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944 .
Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada , Britain , China , and the Soviet Union .
Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944 , Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy .
=== Contemporary era ===
The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor .
After two bitter referendums , Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province .
Canada economic growth , combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments , led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity , marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965 , the implementation of official bilingualism ( English and French ) in 1969 , and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971 .
Socially democratic programs were also instituted , such as Medicare , the Canada Pension Plan , and Canada Student Loans , though provincial governments , particularly Quebec and Alberta , opposed many of these as incursions into their , another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the UK Canada Act 1982 , the patriation of Canada constitution from the United Kingdom , concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country , although the Queen retained her role as monarch of Canada .
In 1999 , Nunavut became Canada third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal the same time , Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s , giving birth to a secular nationalist movement .
The radical Front de libération du Québec ( FLQ ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976 , organizing an unsuccessful referendum on in 1980 .
Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990 .
This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West .
A second referendum followed in 1995 , in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of to percent .
In 1997 , the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament , outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty , a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985 , the largest mass murder in Canadian history ; the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989 , a university shooting targeting female students ; and the Oka Crisis of 1990 , the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Indigenous groups .
Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s , including the UNPROFOR mission in the former sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 , but declined to join the United invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
In 2011 , Canadian forces participated in the intervention into the Libyan Civil War , and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the .
== Geography , climate , and environment == By total area ( including its waters ) , Canada is the country in the world , after Russia .
By land area alone , however , Canada ranks fourth , due to having the world largest proportion of fresh water lakes .
Of Canada thirteen provinces and territories , eight share a border with the United States , and only two are landlocked ( Alberta and Saskatchewan ) , with the remaining eight provinces and three territories directly bordering one of three oceans .
Ontario and Quebec also send most of their shipping traffic through the Lawrence Seaway , which connects the Great Lakes to the Lawrence River , which flows into the Atlantic Ocean .
Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east , along the Arctic Ocean to the north , and to the Pacific Ocean in the west , Canada has the longest coastline in the world , with a total length of kilometres ( mi ) , and occupies much of the continent of North America .
Moreover , Canada border with the contiguous United States to the south and the state of Alaska to the northwest forms the longest international land border in the world , stretching km ( mi ) .
In addition to the , Canada shares a maritime boundary with Greenland to the northeast and with the France overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast .
Canada is home to the world northernmost settlement , Canadian Forces Station Alert , on the northern tip of Ellesmere lies 817 kilometres ( 508 mi ) from the North Pole .
Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost ; however , the future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Canadian Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change .
Three of Canada arctic islands Baffin Island , Victoria Island and Ellesmere Island are among the ten largest in the the end of the last glacial period , Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions , including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield ; 42 percent of the land acreage is covered by forests ( approximately 8 percent of the world forested land ) , made up mostly of spruce , poplar , and pine .
Canada has over of which are greater than 100 km2 ( 39 sq mi ) is more than any other country , containing much of the world fresh water .
There are also glaciers in the Canadian Rockies , the Coast Mountains and the Arctic is geologically active , having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes , notably Mount Meager massif , Mount Garibaldi , Mount Cayley massif , and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex .
The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada worst natural disasters , killing an estimated Nisga a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia .
The eruption produced a ( mi ) lava flow , and , according to Nisga a legend , blocked the flow of the Nass winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region .
Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country , particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces , which experience a continental climate , where daily average temperatures are near ( 5 ) , but can drop below with severe wind chills .
In regions , snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year , while in parts of the north snow can persist .
Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate , with a mild and rainy winter .
On the east and west coasts , average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s ( 70s ) , while between the coasts , the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 ( 77 to 86 ) , with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 ( 104 ) .
== Government and politics ==
Canada is described as a full democracy , with a tradition of liberalism , and an egalitarian , moderate political ideology .
An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada political culture .
Peace , order , and good government , alongside an implied bill of rights are founding principles of the Canadian the federal level , Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practicing brokerage politics , the leaning Liberal Party of Canada and the leaning Conservative Party of Canada ( or its predecessors ) .
The historically predominant Liberal Party position themselves at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned on the right and the New Democratic Party occupying the left .
and politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society .
Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2019 Liberal Party , who currently form a minority government ; the Conservative Party , who are the Official Opposition ; the New Democratic Party ; the Bloc Québécois ; and the Green Party of has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive , legislative , and judicial branches .
The reigning monarch is Queen Elizabeth II , who is also monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada 10 provinces .
The person who is the Canadian monarch is the same as the British monarch , although the two institutions are separate .
The monarch appoints a representative , the governor general ( at present Julie Payette ) , to carry out most of her federal royal duties in direct participation of the monarch and the governor general in areas of governance is limited .
In practice , their use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet , a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons of Canada and chosen and headed by the prime minister ( at present Justin Trudeau ) , the head of government .
The governor general or monarch may , though , in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice .
To ensure the stability of government , the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons .
The Prime Minister Office ( PMO ) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government , initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown , besides the aforementioned , the governor general , lieutenant governors , senators , federal court judges , and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies .
The leader of the party with the seats usually becomes the leader of Her Majesty Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check .
Each of the 338 members of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding .
General elections must be called by the governor general , either on the advice of the prime minister or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House .
Constitutionally , an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election , although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October .
The 105 members of the Senate , whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis , serve until age federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces .
Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons .
Canada three territories also have legislatures , but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces .
The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country .
In addition , the minister of finance and minister of industry utilize the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development .
The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes .
The bank does not issue Canadian coins ; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint .
=== Law ===
The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country , and consists of written text and unwritten conventions .
The Constitution Act , 1867 ( known as the British North America Act prior to 1982 ) , affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments .
The Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy and the Constitution Act , 1982 , ended all legislative ties to Britain , as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually can not be by any a notwithstanding clause allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years .
Canada judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution .
The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since December 18 , 2017 by Chief Justice Richard Wagner .
Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice .
All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with legal bodies .
The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial law prevails everywhere except in Quebec , where civil law predominates .
Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada .
Law enforcement , including criminal courts , is officially a provincial responsibility , conducted by provincial and municipal police forces .
However , in most rural areas and some urban areas , policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada .
Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples .
Most notably , a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921 .
These treaties are agreements between the Canadian with the duty to consult and accommodate .
The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .
These rights may include provision of services , such as health care through the Indian Health Transfer Policy , and exemption from taxation .
=== Foreign relations and military ===
Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions .
Canada foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations , and through the work of numerous federal institutions .
Canada peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image .

Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs .
Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976 .
Canada joined the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001 .
Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Economic Cooperation forum ( APEC ) and the United States share the world longest undefended border , on military campaigns and exercises , and are each other largest trading partner .
Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy , most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba , and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie .
Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands , owing , in part , to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War , World War I and World War II .
Since then , Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism , making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations .
During the Cold War , Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) in cooperation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union .
During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , future Prime Minister Lester Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force , for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize .
As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission , Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept .
Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions , including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989 , and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda , the former Yugoslavia , and elsewhere ; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries , notably in the 1993 Somalia 2001 , Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the stabilization force and the , International Security Assistance Force .
In February 2007 , Canada , Italy , the United Kingdom , Norway , and Russia announced their joint commitment to a project to help develop vaccines for developing nations , and called on other countries to join them .
In August 2007 , Canada territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole ; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925 .
In September 2020 , Canada joined the Vaccines Global Access ( COVAX ) program , which aims to ensure equal access to a potential vaccine for all member countries and to help countries secure nation employs a professional , volunteer military force of approximately active personnel and reserve personnel .
The unified Canadian Forces ( CF ) comprise the Canadian Army , Royal Canadian Navy , and Royal Canadian Air Force .
In 2013 , Canada military expenditure totalled approximately CA 19 billion , or around one percent of the country GDP .
Following the 2016 Defense Policy Review , called Strong , Secure , Engaged , the Canadian government announced a 70 percent increase to the country defence budget over the next decade .
The Canadian Forces will acquire 88 fighter planes and 15 naval surface combatants based on the Type 26 frigate design , the latter as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy .
Canada total military expenditure is expected to reach CA billion by 2027 .
Canada military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas , including in Iraq , Ukraine , and the Caribbean Sea .
=== Provinces and territories ===
Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories .
In turn , these may be grouped into four main regions : Western Canada , Central Canada , Atlantic Canada , and Northern Canada ( Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together ) .
Provinces have more autonomy than territories , having responsibility for social programs such as health care , education , and welfare .
Together , the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government , an almost unique structure among federations in the world .
Using its spending powers , the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas , such as the Canada Health Act ; the provinces can opt out of these , but rarely do so in practice .
Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces .
The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act , 1867 , whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada .
The powers flowing from the Constitution Act , 1867 are divided between the Government of Canada ( the federal government ) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively .
A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment , whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government .

Canada economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II .
The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry .
In the 1970s , concerns over energy and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program ( NEP ) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency ( FIRA ) .
