Basketball is a team sport where two teams , usually consisting of five players on each team , play against each other on a rectangular court .
The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a backboard on the opponent side of the court , while preventing the opponent from shooting it into your team hoop .
It is a very popular sport worldwide , played with a round and usually orange ball that bounces .
Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling , shooting , running , and jumping .
Each made basket is worth two points , while a basket made from beyond the line is worth three points .
If a player gets into too much physical contact , they may be given free throws which are worth one point each .
The game typically lasts for and the team with the most points at the end of the win the game .
If the score is tied at the end of the game , there will be something called overtime , which is additional play time to allow one team to win the match .
The game is played between men teams or between women teams .
Basketball has been played in the Summer Olympic Games since 1936 .
The shot clock rule started in 1954 .
The first basketball game took place in 1892 , where the court was half the size of what it is 1891 the game was invented by James Naismith .
== The history of basketball ==
In early December 1891 , James Naismith , a Canadian physical education teacher at Springfield College in Springfield , Massachusetts , invented an indoor game called basketball .
He invented the sport to keep his students from becoming bored during the winter .
Naismith wrote the basic rules and then nailed a peach basket onto a tall pole .
Unlike modern basketball hoops , the bottom of the was still there , so after a point was scored , somebody had to get the ball out of the basket with a long stick .
Over time , people made a hole at the bottom of the basket so the ball could go through more easily .
The first game of basketball was played at the International Young Men Christian Association ( YMCA ) in Springfield , Massachusetts .
The score of the first game of basketball ever played was .
There is a sculpture in Springfield , outside where the first game was held .
The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is also in Springfield .
For that first game of basketball in 1891 , Naismith used two peach baskets as goals , which gave the sport its name .
The students were enthusiastic .
After much running and shooting , William Chase made a midcourt shot , which was the only score in that historic contest .
Word spread about the newly invented game , and numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules , which were published in the January 15 , 1892 , issue of the Triangle , the YMCA Training School campus paper .
Since the rules had not been formally written , there was no maximum number of players then , unlike today .
This also meant that there were no set rules to the game ; Naismith only observed how it was played and changed the rules accordingly .
=== Rules ===
The aim of basketball is to score more points than the other team , by making the ball in the basket .
Players on one team try to stop players on the other team from scoring .
Baskets can be worth 1 , 2 , or 3 points .
Each normal score is worth two points ; however , if a player throws the ball into the hoop from behind the large arched line on the court , called the line , the score is worth three points .
You get points by shooting ( throwing or dropping ) the ball into the opponents basket .
The team with the most points at the end of the game wins .
The ball is moved forward by shooting , passing ( throwing or handing off ) or dribbling it .
The ball may not be carried by a player who is walking or running without dribbling it .
If this rule is violated , it is called a travel .
=== Equipment ===
The court , where the game is played , is a rectangle , and at both end lines there is a goal called a hoop in the shape of a circle basket with the bottom cut out .
In each game of basketball these things are required : Basketball Basketball court Basketball hoop and backboard === Teams ===
Basketball is played with two teams , with 5 players from each team on the court at one time .
The maximum number of players on the bench differs by the league .
In international play , a maximum of 7 players is allowed on the bench , resulting in a roster of 12 players .
The NBA has rosters ; college and high school teams have rosters .
When a player wants to substitute for another player on the court , they let the score bench know .
The referees will signal for the player waiting to come into the court .
The player that was in the game comes off the court and the player that was sitting on the bench goes inside the game .
This is called a substitution .
In regional matches , in some areas , a minimum of 3 players are required to be on the bench .
In India , there might be leeway in the number depending on the category of the tournament you playing in .
=== Playing regulations ===
A game of basketball is made up of four different quarters , each ten ( or in the National Basketball Association , 12 ) minutes long .
In the NCAA , or National Collegiate Athletic Association , there are 2 20 minute halves .
At the start of every game the referee throws the basketball up in the air , and one player from each team tries to hit it to their teammates , that is called a jump ball .
At the start of each quarter the team who has the possession arrow pointing towards their hoop gets the ball .
Then the arrow is switched , and the next team gets the ball next quarter .
After , the team who scores the most points wins .
If the two teams score the same number of points , there is a overtime to see who can score more points .
Overtime can be played over and over until one team finally scores more points .
If a player does something illegal in the game , it is called a foul .
If a player fouls someone on the other team who is shooting the basketball , the player who was fouled gets to shoot free throws from the foul line .
A free throw is a shot that no one is allowed to try to block .
A free throw is shot from the straight line in front of the hoop .
Each successful free throw is worth one point .
If a player fouls an opponent who is not shooting , the other team gets the ball , and can throw it in bounds from the sideline .
Players can do three things with the ball : dribble ( bounce ) the ball , pass the ball to a teammate , or shoot the ball at the hoop .
The player with the ball tries to keep the ball and not let the other team get it .
The ball ca be kicked or hit with the fist .
If this is violated , the other team gets possession of the ball and gets to throw it in from the nearest out of bounds area .
Once a player commits five fouls , he is no longer allowed to play in the game , and a player on the bench must go in the game immediately .
If a team commits four fouls , the opposing team gets to shoot a free throw on any next foul that does involve shooting .
( Depending on the league ) .
== Officials ==
In a game of basketball , there are a number of officials who are not from either team , who are there to help .
Officials are important to the game , and help it run efficiently .
Here is a list of some of these people : Umpire : There are either one , two , three , four or five umpires in a game of basketball .
It is the umpires job to make the game more fair by enforcing the rules of the game .
The umpires take into consideration the spirit and intent of the player before making any call .
In the NBA and WNBA , the term umpire is not used ; the person who has this role is called the referee .
Referee : The use of this word varies between rule sets .
Under the rules of FIBA ( the worldwide governing body for the sport ) , the NCAA ( college basketball ) , and NFHS ( high schools ) , there is one referee in a game of basketball .
He is the head umpire .
The referee has all the jobs of the umpires along with a couple more responsibilities .
He is also the one that makes the final decision for most problems and is the one who throws the ball up for the tip off at the start of the match .
The first ever recorded female referee is Isabelle Johnson from Melbourne .
The first ever recorded male referee is Campbell Grech from Melbourne .
Timekeeper : There is one timekeeper whose job is to keep track of the time and to tell the umpires when time for each quarter has run out .
Scorekeeper : There is one scorekeeper whose job is to keep track of and record all points scored , shots attempted , fouls made and timeouts called .
Assistant Scorekeeper : There is one assistant scorekeeper .
His job is to assist the scorekeeper , by telling him the players who score points , and to hold up a number for each foul called , showing everyone the number of fouls the specified player has for the game .
Shot Clock Operator : There is one shot clock operator and his job is to keep resetting and holding the device when needed or told to by an umpire .
This person needs to have good reflexes and quickness , as he has to quickly reset the timer when the game and media in North America will often use referee to describe all officials , whether their formal titles are referee , umpire , or crew chief .

=== Positions in basketball ===
In professional basketball teams , each player has a position .
A position is a job or role that a player has to take part in to play the game .
If everyone is doing their job correctly , the team is usually successful .
Point guard ( PG ) ( 1 ) - point guards are responsible for leading the team on offense .
They have to take the ball out ( to dribble the ball halfway across their team court side into the opposing team court side ) and plan an attack or play - to pass the ball to a player and he passes on to another player and so on till a player shoots the basketball .
Point guards can be small , but they have to be very fast and possess good .
But the most important thing for the PG is a wide view .
PG should control the game when on offense .
That why PG is called coach on the court .
Shooting guard ( SG ) ( 2 ) - shooting guards generally are a little bit taller and slower than point guards .
They have to make good shots from far distances ( like lines ) .
Small forward ( SF ) ( 3 ) - small forwards are generally taller than both point guards and shooting guards .
They are the team most versatile player , doing everything from rebounding and assisting to scoring .
Power forward ( PF ) ( 4 ) - power forwards are usually one of the strongest players who play inside the line .
Their job is to receive rebounds from under the basket and score in the opposing team basket , although it is unusual for a power forward to score most points for the team .
Center ( C ) ( 5 ) - Centers will usually be the tallest player on the team .
They score close to the basket , rebound and block shots on the defensive end .
They also start the game in the tip positions , more usual in professional basketball teams , are used in basketball .
Swingman - a basketball player who can play both small forward and shooting guard positions .
Stretch four ( also cornerman ) - a basketball player who can play both power forward and small forward positions .

=== 3 on 3 ===
This is the most popular pick up game variation of basketball .
Pick up games are when teams are chosen on the court instead of having official teams .
Due to there being no referee , this more casual game has more relaxed rules than official games .
Instead of 5 players , there are only three players on each team , hence the name .
While the exact rules vary from place to place , there are several common rules typically found in most games , including : The game is played on a instead of a .

( If one player , if the shot is made team gets the ball first , if not , the other team gets the ball .
Sometimes called shooting die .
) There are officially sponsored 3 on 3 tournaments , though the game is mostly played without an official league .
Variations with 2 player and 4 player teams often follow this same format .

When a player makes a shot , he or she scores 2 points and is then awarded a chance to score an additional 3 points by attempting a series of .
If a player makes a , he or she is awarded an additional point and an additional .
If a player makes three straight they are then given the ball a the top of the key and the other players may then defend .
One special rule is that if a player gets 20 points and then misses a , or scores 17 points and then makes all three , their score is set back to 15 .
This is because their next basket would put them over 21 points , and the object of the game is to get exactly 21 .

There are no fouls , travelling violations , or .
Play continues despite any of these .

The other layer has to repeat their shot .
If they miss , they get an H added , until they get enough letters to finish the word horse and they lose .
If the player who has the ball missed their shot , no letter is added and control moves to the next player .
