== History ==
The tomato is native to western South America .
Wild versions were small , like cherry tomatoes , and most likely yellow instead of red .
The Spanish first showed tomatoes to Europe , where they became used in Spanish and Italian food .
The French and northern Europeans wrongly thought that they were poisonous because they are a member of the deadly nightshade family .
The leaves and immature fruit contains tomatine , which in large amounts would be toxic .
However , the ripe fruit contains no tomatine .
== As food ==
The tomato is grown and eaten around the world .
It is used in many ways , such as raw in salads or in slices , stewed , a part of a wide variety of dishes , or processed into ketchup or tomato soup .
