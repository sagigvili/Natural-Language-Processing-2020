It was first shown on CBS on September 24 , 2007 .
== Overview ==
The show starts by being centred on two male Caltech scientists who share an apartment in Pasadena , California .
They are in their twenties and are both single for the first two seasons .
One is an experimental physicist from New Jersey ( Leonard Hofstadter ) .
The other is a theoretical physicist from Texas ( Sheldon Cooper ) .
Sheldon has Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and has a very low sex drive .
They live across the hall from an attractive , bottle-blonde waitress from Nebraska ( Penny ) .
She is single and lives on her own for most of the show 's run .
She tried to become an actress , but only got a role in a television advertisement and a role in a B-movie called Serial Apeist as well as its sequel .
Leonard and Sheldon 's geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Penny 's social skills , popularity and lively sex life for comedic effect .
Two equally geeky , single friends of Sheldon and Leonard 's , Jewish Howard and Indian Rajesh , are also main characters .
Howard lived with his mother during the first few seasons .
Raj lives on his own .
The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions .
In March 2014 , it was announced that The Big Bang Theory would continue for at least three more seasons on CBS.The show began as a sitcom about four geeky , male scientists and their fun-loving , under-educated , socially successful waitress neighbour .
Much of the humor revolved around the differences between scientists and the rest of the characters , especially Penny .

Bernadette Rostenkowski was brought in during season 3 and started a relationship with Howard .
The couple later married and had a daughter .
Amy Farrah-Fowler was also brought in during season 3 and started a relationship with Sheldon ; they later got engaged .
Leonard and Penny became a couple and married .

== Production history ==
The show was first developed for the 2006-2007 television season .
At that time , it was very different from the show that was later broadcast .
Only Jim Parsons Johnny Galecki were part of the original pilot .
The character now played by Kaley Cuoco was much meaner to the geeks .
CBS did not pick the show up , but gave Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre a second chance .
They brought in Kaley Cuoco , Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar .
They retooled the show.The second pilot of The Big Bang Theory was directed by award-winning television directing veteran James Burrows .
He decided not to stay with the show .
This reworked pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14 , 2007 .
Before its airing on CBS , the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge .
The show premiered September 24 , 2007 .
It was picked up for a full 22-episode season order on October 19 , 2007.Production on the show was halted on November 6 , 2007 by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike .
When the strike ended , the show was picked up for a second season for the 2008-2009 television season.The show returned on March 17 , 2008 .
It had an earlier time slot and nine new episodes .
The second season premiered , in the same slot , on September 22 , 2008 .
During that season , the show 's ratings grew .
That led to a two-year renewal through the 2010-11 season.David Saltzberg , a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California , Los Angeles , checks scripts and provides dialogue , math equations and diagrams used as props .
He says he is more consultant than contributor .
Executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady said , In fact , we 're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he 's going to be working on throughout the [ first ] season so there 's actual progress to the boards We worked hard to get all the science right .
