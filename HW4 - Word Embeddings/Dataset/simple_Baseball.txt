Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played on a field by two teams against each other .
In baseball , a player on one team throws a small round ball at a player on the other team , who tries to hit it with a bat .
Then the player who hits the ball has to run around the field .
Players get points by running around in a full circle around three points on the ground called bases , to back where they started , which is called home plate .
They have to do this without getting caught by the players on the other team .
Baseball started in the United States in the 1700s and 1800s , The game was made by Abner Doubleday .
Many people in North America , South America , and East Asia play baseball , but the sport is most known in the United States and Japan .
In the U.S. , baseball is called the national pastime , because so many people in the United States used to spend a lot of time playing or watching baseball games .
Today , though , most Americans follow football more than baseball , especially when it comes time for the Super Bowl .
== How baseball is played ==
A game of baseball is played by two teams on a baseball field .
Each team has 9 players .
There are also 4 umpires .
There is one for where young players play .
Umpires watch everything carefully to decide what happened , make calls about a play , and make sure everyone follows the rules .
On a baseball field , there are four bases .
The bases form a diamond that goes around the field to the right from the starting base .
The starting base is called home plate .
Home plate is a pentagon , which is a shape that has five sides .
First base is on the right side of the field , second base is at the top of the infield , third base is on the left side of the field , and home plate is at the back of the field , where the catcher plays .
The game is played in innings .
Professional baseball games have 9 innings .
In an inning , each team has one turn to bat and try to score runs , adding one point .
When one team hits the ball , the other team defends and tries to get three players on the other team out .
The team that is playing defense always has the ball .
This is different from other team sports .
When the team on defense gets three players out , it is their turn to try and score runs .
Then the team that was batting starts playing defense , and the team that was playing defense starts batting .
After nine innings , the team that has the most runs is the winner .
If the teams have the same number of runs , they play more innings until one team wins .
At the start of the game , the home team pitches , while players on the visiting team bat .
Only one player can bat at a time .
The baseball field , or diamond , has two main parts , the infield and the outfield .
The infield is where the four bases are .
The outfield is beyond the bases , from the view of home plate .
The lines from home plate to first base and home plate to third base are the foul lines , and the ground outside of these lines is called foul territory .
A ball that is hit with a bat and flies between the foul lines is a fair ball , and the batter and runners can try and run around the bases and score .
A ball that is outside the foul lines is a foul ball .
If the ball hits the ground in the foul area rather than being caught in the air , the batter continues to bat , and any runners must return to the base that they were on before the ball was hit .
If the batter has fewer than two strikes , a foul ball counts as a strike .
If the batter already has two strikes , and the foul ball is not caught in the air , then the batter continues to hit .
If a ball is caught by a fielder in fair or foul ground , the batter is out .
The most important part of the game is between the pitcher and the batter .
The pitcher throws , or pitches , the ball towards home plate .
The pitcher normally throws the ball close enough for the batter to hit it .
If the pitcher throws the ball in the strike zone , which is the area over home plate and between the hitter 's knee and chest , the pitch is a strike , unless the batter hits the ball .
The pitch is always a strike , regardless of where it is , if the batter swings the bat and misses , so the batter must have good aim with the bat .
Three strikes are a strikeout , and this is one way to make an out .
A pitch that the batter does not swing at , and which is not called a strike , is a ball .
On the fourth ball thrown by a pitcher , the batter walks to first base , so it is important to pitch well .
The catcher for the pitcher 's team waits behind the batter , and catches any ball that the batter does not hit .
The catcher uses signals to tell the pitcher where to throw the ball .
If the pitcher does not like what the catcher says , he will shake his head , which signals no .
If he agrees with what the catcher has signaled , he will nod his head , which signals yes .
There are many ways to get batters out , and runners can also be gotten out .
Some common ways to get batters out are catching a batted ball in the air , whether in fair or foul territory , throwing the ball to the defensive player at first base ( an out if it gets there before the batter ) , and a strikeout .
A runner can be put out by tagging the runner while the runner is not on a base , and by forcing him out ( when a base is touched before a player can get there , with no base for the runner to go back to ) .
When the fielding team has put out three of the batting team 's players , the half-inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places .
The batting team wants to get runs .
In order to get a run , a player must bat , then become a base runner , touch all the bases in order , and then touch home plate without being called out .
So first , the batter wants to make other players get to home plate , or to run the bases himself .
Runners can not pass each other while running the bases .
A base runner who touches home plate after touching all previous bases in order , and without getting out , scores a run .
If the batter hits the ball over the fence ( between the foul lines ) without touching the ground , it is a home run .
The batter , and any base-runners , are allowed to advance to the home plate and score a run .
The fielding team can do nothing to stop them .
=== Fielding team ===
The team on the field tries not to let the team who 's batting get any runs .
The fielding team has a pitcher and a catcher .
The remaining seven fielders can stand anywhere in the field .
However , there are usually four people that stand around the infield close to the bases and three outfielders who stand around the outfield .
The four infielders are the first baseman , second baseman , shortstop , and third baseman .
The first baseman and third baseman stand close to first base and third base .
The second baseman and the shortstop stand on either side of second base .
The first baseman 's job is to make force plays at first base .
In a force play , another infielder catches a ball that has touched the ground , and throws it to the first baseman .
The first baseman must then touch the batter or the base with the ball before the batter can touch first base .
Then the batter is out .
First basemen need to have quick feet , stretch well , be quick and know how to catch wild throws .
First base is one of the most important positions as a significant number of plays happen there .
The second baseman 's job is to cover the area to the right of second base and to back the first baseman up .
The shortstop 's job is to cover the area between second and third bases .
This is where right-handed batters usually hit ground balls .
The shortstop also covers second or third base and the near part of left field .
The shortstop is usually the best fielder on the team .
The third baseman needs to have a strong throwing arm .
This is because many times the batter will hit a ball toward third base .
The third baseman must throw the ball very quickly to the first baseman , to get the runner out .
Because the balls that go to third base are usually hit very hard , the third baseman must also be very quick .
The three outfielders are called the left fielder , the center fielder , and the right fielder , because they stand in left field , center field and right field .
Left field and right field are on the left and right sides , if you look out from home plate .
Center field is straight ahead from home plate .
Center field is very big , so the center fielder is usually the fastest .
The team can decide where to put the infielders and outfielders .
Players often stand at slightly different places on the field between some plays .
These changes are called shifts .
The fielders may shift at any time .
Players can shift for many reasons .
One of the more popular ones is the defensive shift , where players move in the infield .
They do this because they know that some batters can only hit a ball a certain direction .
It can also be easier to make a double play when fielders are moved a certain way .
==== Pitching ====
Teams can change pitchers during a game .
Teams change their pitchers often because it is hard for a pitcher to throw a full game of nine innings .
A pitcher can sometimes throw a no-hitter where no one on the opposite team gets an earned hit .
A team can use as many pitchers as it wants to , but it is rare to use more than eight in a game .
The ways that a pitcher throws the ball are called pitches .
Many professional pitchers use two or more different pitches .
Pitchers change which pitch they throw so that the batter will be tricked and not know what pitch to expect .
This makes it more difficult for the batter to hit the ball .
Pitchers can make the ball move differently : faster or slower , closer or farther from the batter , higher or lower .
There are also many types of pitches , such as the slurve , curve , slider , splitter , sinker , screw , 2-seam cut , 2-seam screw , knuckle , knuckle curve , change-up , circle change-up , palm ball , and others .
When throwing the ball , the pitcher must touch the pitchers mound with his foot .
The pitcher 's rubber is on top of the mound .
The pitcher can not take more than one step forward when he throws the ball .
That makes the pitcher throw the ball slower .
Many major-league pitchers can throw the ball up to 100 miles per hour ( 145 km/h ) .
Throwing a baseball that fast can be bad for the body .
Pitchers can end up with a lot of injuries .
Doctors often will perform Tommy John surgery on a pitcher with an elbow injury .
The operation is named after Tommy John , the first pitcher to have the surgery .
Today , pitchers are able to recover from their injuries much more often than before Tommy John surgery .
=== The batting team ===
The batting team wants to get runs .
The batting team sends its players up to home plate in a special order .
This order is called the lineup .
Each team chooses its lineup at the start of the game .
After the game starts , the team can not change the order .
But the team can use a player who was not on the lineup .
The new player has to change with an original player .
The new player 's name is written in the lineup where the original player 's name was .
After the ninth player has batted , the first player in the lineup starts again .
If a runner comes to home plate , he scores a run .
Then he is not a base runner .
After scoring a run , the player must leave the field until it is his turn again .
So a player can only score one run for each time he bats .
Since people began to have more free time , baseball has become the national pastime of America .
About 12 million people play baseball in the United States .
== Baseball terms ==
=== The field ===
See the image above for a diagram of the playing field.Base : Four points on the field the players must run to .
The player starts at Home plate and must go to each of the other bases in order and return to Home plate to score a run .
The other bases are named First base , Second base and Third base .
Home plate is a piece of hard rubber and the other bases are made of cloth .
In professional baseball , the bases are 90 feet from each other .
The bases on the field are in the shape of a diamond .
Baseline : the line between each of the bases in order .
For example , from home plate to first base , from first base to second base , and so on .
Base path : The area along the baseline where the players run from base to base .
Ball : A pitch that was thrown outside the strike zone and that the batter did not swing at .
Strike : A pitch that was thrown inside the strike zone and that the batter did not swing at , a pitch that the batter swung at and missed , or a ball that the batter hit into foul territory .
Dugout : the place where the players and coaches who are not on the field sit .
Bullpen : the place where the pitchers watch the game and warm up before they start playing or when they are not playing .
Outfield : where three players play , typically where the best arm , the fastest and the second best arm play == The Game ==
Grounder : A ball that bounces and rolls on the ground after being hit .
Pop Fly : A ball that goes high in the air after being hit .
It can be caught for an out or it can fall for a hit Double Play : When the defense gets two outs on one play .
Often happens when a ground ball is hit to an infielder with a runner on base .
Bunt : when the batter holds his bat out to try and hit the ball rather than swinging it .
A bunted ball does not go far usually .
Pitchers often bunt because they are not as good at hitting .
A bunt is also often used when trying to advance another runner already on one of the bases .
This is called a sacrifice or sacrifice bunt .
Hit : When the batter hits the ball ( thrown by the pitcher ) in fair territory .
Home Run : When the batter hits the ball outside the baseball field , he ( and any runners on base ) gets to run all of the bases and scores at home plate .
