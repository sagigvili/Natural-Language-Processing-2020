Football is a word which could mean one of several sports .
The best-known type of football is association football .
This is called soccer in North America , South Africa , and Australia to avoid confusion with other types of football that are commonly played there .
The name football comes from the two words 'foot ' and 'ball ' .
It is named football because the players of the game walk and often run ( on their feet ) while playing , as opposed to ( for example ) polo where the players ride horses .
Football is played using a ball , also called a 'football ' , that is usually shaped like a sphere or an ellipsoid .
The ball is often kicked with the foot , but depending on the game , it can also be hit using other parts of the body ( in association football ) and handling the ball is a part of some other sports known as 'football ' .
Some elements of football have been seen in many countries , dating back to the second and third century AD in China .
The modern games of both rugby football and association football comes from 19th-century England .
Kicking a ball goes back to the Middle Ages .
