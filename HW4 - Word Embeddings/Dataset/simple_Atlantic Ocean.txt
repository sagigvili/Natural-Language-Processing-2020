The Atlantic Ocean is the world 's second largest ocean .
It covers a total area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres ( 41,100,000 square miles ) .
It covers about 20 percent of the Earth 's surface .
It is named after the god Atlas from Greek mythology .
Its name means Sea of Atlas .
== Geologic history ==
The Atlantic formed when the Americas moved west from Eurasia and Africa .
This began sometime in the Cretaceous period , roughly 135 million years ago .
It was part of the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea.The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa , and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time ( continental drift ) .
The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now , because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge , while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle .
== Geography ==
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America .
It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait , Greenland Sea , Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea .
It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar.In the southeast , the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean .
The East meridian defines its border.In the southwest , the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean .
The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific.The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific .
It occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres ( 41,100,000 sq mi ) .
The volume of the Atlantic , along with its adjacent seas ( the seas next to it ) , is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres.The average depth of the Atlantic , along with its adjacent seas , is 3,339 metres ( 1,826 fathoms ; 10,955 ft ) .
The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico , where the Ocean is 8,380 metres ( 4,580 fathoms ; 27,490 ft ) deep .
=== Gulf Stream ===
The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents .
One of these , called the Gulf Stream , flows across the North Atlantic .
Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole .
This makes France , Ireland , Britain , Iceland , and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada .
Without the Gulf Stream , the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same , because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole.There are currents in the South Atlantic too , but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa .
== Geology ==
The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean 's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge .
It runs from north to south under the Ocean .
This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates : Eurasian , North American , South American and African .
The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about south.The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 33â€“37 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season .
