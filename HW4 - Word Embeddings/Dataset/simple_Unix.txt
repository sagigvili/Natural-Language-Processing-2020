UNIX is a computer operating system .
It was first developed in 1969 at Bell Labs .
Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , Douglas McIlroy , and others created it .
They used assembly language to write it .
In 1972 , the Unix code was rewritten with the new C programming language .
The Unix operating system is a multiuser and multiprocessing system .
This means it can run several application programs at the same time , for more than one user at the same time .
It also is able to operate well in a network of computers .
Computer security is also important in Unix , because many people can have access to it , both by using a computer directly or over a network .
Many ideas in Unix were new .
Other operating systems copied them .
Today , there are many operating systems that have some of the ideas of Unix in them .
For this reason , some people talk about a Unix philosophy of doing things .
Linux is one of these systems with many of the Unix ideas in it .
Linux does not use code from UNIX .
Linux only shares some of the ideas and the names of commands .
So , Linux is not a UNIX operating system .
Instead it is called Unix-like .
There can be many different users in a Unix and Unix-like operating system .
Most of them have a personal area where they can put things .
This is called a user account .
One way of using a Unix system is with the command line interface .
Users run commands and programs by typing text characters .
This takes time to learn , but it is a very powerful and flexible way of working .
It is still used by most Unix administrators .
These commands are run in a shell , which can change slightly between one system and another .
A graphical user interface ( GUI ) is the other method .
The X Window System is a very common GUI for Unix systems .
The X Window System is only a shell of a graphical interface .
It has many protocols .
The X Window System itself does not let the user to move and resize windows .
Users need a window manager or desktop manager to do that .
Some of the popular desktop and window managers are : Gnome KDE Windowmaker XfceLike most other graphical user interfaces , they use windows , dialog boxes , support the use of a computer mouse , and are designed to be easy to use .
There are many thousands of programs available for the X Window System .
Programs like word processors and spreadsheets are available including free and open-source software .
== Two types of Unix ==
Today , there are two kinds of operating systems that are like UNIX .
The first group is all those that share some kernel code with the original from Bell Labs at AT T .
This includes the commercial UNIX types : Solaris or AIX .
The second group includes free operating systems that usually have BSD in their name , like FreeBSD , OpenBSD , and NetBSD .
These are based on free BSD .
Mac OS X is also based on BSD.There are also free systems based on the Linux kernel .
These do not share any code with the original UNIX .
BSD systems share very little code with the original Unix because much of the code has been rewritten over many years .
Many people use the terms Unix and Unix-like systems to be clear .
Most applications can run on any modern Unix or Unix-like system .
KDE and GNOME were developed for Linux and later changed to run on commercial types of Unix .
