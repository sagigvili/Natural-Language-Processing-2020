== Life ==
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12 , 1809 , in Hodgenville , Kentucky , United States .
His parents were Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks .
His family was very poor .
Abraham had one brother and one sister .
His brother died in childhood .
They grew up in a small log cabin , with just one room inside .
Although slavery was legal in Kentucky at that time , Lincoln 's father , who was a religious Baptist , refused to own any slaves .
When Lincoln was seven years old , his family moved to Indiana .
Later they moved to Illinois .
In his childhood he helped his father on the farm , but when he was 22 years old he left home and moved to New Salem , Illinois , where he worked in a general store .
Later , he said that he had gone to school for just one year , but that was enough to learn how to read , write , and do simple math .
In 1842 , he married Mary Todd .
They had four children , but three of them died when they were very young .
Abraham Lincoln was sometimes called Abe Lincoln or Honest Abe after he ran miles to give a customer the right amount of change .
The nickname Honest Abe came from a time when he started a business that failed .
Instead of running away like many people would have , he stayed and worked to pay his debt .
== Early political career ==
Lincoln started his political career in 1832 when he ran for the IGA Illinois General Assembly , but he lost the election .
He served as a captain in the Illinois militia during the Black Hawk War , a war with Native American tribes .
When he moved to Springfield in 1837 , he began to work as a lawyer .
Soon , he became one of the most highly respected lawyers in Illinois .
In 1837 , as a member of the Illinois General Assembly , Lincoln issued a written protest of its passage of a resolution stating that slavery could not be abolished in Washington , D.C.In 1841 , he won a court case ( Bailey Cromwell ) .
He represented a black woman who claimed she had already been freed and could not be sold as a slave .
In 1847 , he lost a case ( Matson Rutherford ) representing a slave owner ( Robert Matson ) claiming return of fugitive slaves .
After he moved to Illinois , he worked as a shopkeeper and postmaster .
He rode the circuit of courts for many years .
When he was 21 , he worked on a flatboat that carried freight .
He joined the Independent Spy Corp. At first , he was a member of the Whig Party .
He later became a Republican .
Lincoln ran for senate against Stephen Douglas .
Douglas won .
In 1846 , Lincoln joined the Whig Party and was elected to one term in the House of Representatives .
After that , he ignored his political career and instead worked as a lawyer .
In 1854 , in reaction to the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , Lincoln became involved in politics again .
He joined the Republican Party , which had recently been formed in opposition to the expansion of slavery .
In 1858 , he wanted to become senator ; although this was unsuccessful , the debates drew national attention to him .
The Republican Party nominated him for the Presidential election of 1860 .
== Presidency ==
Lincoln was chosen as a candidate for the elections in 1860 for different reasons .
Among these reasons were that his views on slavery were less extreme than those of other people who wanted to be candidates .
Lincoln was from what was then one of the Western states , and had a bigger chance of winning the election there .
Other candidates that were older or more experienced than him had enemies inside the party .
Lincoln 's family was poor , which added to the Republican position of free labor , the opposite of slave labor .
Lincoln won the election in 1860 , and was made the 16th President of the United States .
He won with almost no votes in the South .
For the first time , a president had won the election because of the large support he got from the states in the North .
During his presidency Lincoln became well-known because of his large stovepipe hat .
He used his tall hat to store papers and documents when he was traveling .
=== The Civil War ===
After Lincoln 's election in 1860 , seven States ( South Carolina , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Texas and Louisiana ) formed the Confederate States of America .
When the United States refused to surrender Fort Sumter in Charleston , South Carolina , the Confederates attacked the fort , beginning the American Civil War .
Later , four more states ( Arkansas , Virginia , Tennessee , and North Carolina ) joined the Confederacy for a total of eleven .
In his whole period as President , he had to rebuild the Union with military force and many bloody battles .
He also had to stop the border states , like Kentucky , Missouri , and Maryland , from leaving the Union and joining the Confederacy .
Lincoln was not a general , and had only been in the army for a short time during the Black Hawk War .
However , he still took a major role in the war , often spending days and days in the War Department .
His plan was to cut off the South by surrounding it with ships , control the Mississippi River , and take Richmond , the Confederate capital .
He often clashed with generals in the field , especially George McClellan , and fired generals who lost battles or were not aggressive enough .
Eventually , he made Ulysses Grant the top general in the army .
=== Emancipation Proclamation ===
With the Emancipation Proclamation begun on January 1 , 1863 , Lincoln ordered the freedom of all slaves in those states still in rebellion during the American Civil War .
It did not actually immediately free all those slaves however , since those areas were still controlled by the rebelling states of the Confederacy .
Only a small number of slaves already behind Union lines were immediately freed .
As the Union army advanced , nearly all four million slaves were effectively freed .
Some former slaves joined the Union army after 1862 .
The Proclamation also did not free slaves in the slave states that had remained loyal to the Union ( the federal government of the US ) .
Neither did it apply to areas where Union forces had already regained control , as in Tennessee .
Until the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1865 , only the states had power to end slavery within their own borders , so Lincoln issued the proclamation as a war measure .
The Proclamation made freeing the slaves a Union goal for the war , and put an end to movements in European nations ( especially in Great Britain and France ) that would have recognized the Confederacy as an independent nation .
Lincoln then sponsored a constitutional amendment to free all slaves .
The Thirteenth Amendment , making slavery illegal everywhere in the United States , was passed late in 1865 , eight months after Lincoln was assassinated .
=== Gettysburg Address ===
Lincoln made a famous speech after the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 called the Gettysburg Address .
The battle was very important , and many soldiers from both sides died .
The speech was given at the new cemetery for the dead soldiers .
It is one of the most famous speeches in American history .
=== Second term and assassination ===
Lincoln was re-elected president by a slim margin in 1864 and re-inaugurated March 4 , 1865 .
Soon afterwards , it appeared likely that the Union would win the Civil War .
Lincoln proposed lenient terms for restoring self-government in the states that had rebelled .
On April 9 , 1865 , the leading Confederate general , Robert Lee , surrendered his armies .
On April 11 , 1865 , Lincoln gave a speech in which he promoted voting rights for black American citizens .
During the day on April 14 , 1865 , Lincoln signed the legislation that created the secret service , the US President 's security force .
On the evening of April 14 , Lincoln went to attend a play with his wife , Mary Todd at Ford 's Theater in Washington , D.C
He had invited Ulysses Grant to attend the play with him and his wife Mary Todd , and Grant planned to attend .
As a general , Grant would have brought his own extra military security force , but he did not attend the play because his wife Julia and Mary Todd did not get along well .
During the third act of the play , John Wilkes Booth , a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland , entered the presidential box and shot Lincoln at point-blank range , mortally wounding him , and shouted Sic semper tyrannis ( Thus always to tyrants ) .
An unconscious Lincoln was carried across the street to Petersen House .
He was placed diagonally on the bed because his tall frame would not fit normally on the smaller bed .
He remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the next morning .
According to some accounts , at his last drawn breath , on the morning after the assassination , he smiled broadly and then expired .
Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated.Booth escaped , but died from shots fired during his capture on April 26 .
== Legacy ==
Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest U.S. presidents .
He is often considered the greatest president for his leadership during the American Civil War and his eloquence in speeches such as the Gettysburg Address .
