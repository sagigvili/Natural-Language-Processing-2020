Antarctica is the Earth 's southernmost continent .
It is on the South Pole .
It is almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle .
Around Antarctica is the Southern Ocean .
It is the fifth-largest continent in area after Asia , Africa , North America , and South America .
About 99 of Antarctica is covered by ice .
This ice averages at least 1.6 kilometers ( 1.0 miles ) thick .
Antarctica is the coldest , driest and windiest continent .
It is also , on average , the highest of all the continents .
Antarctica is considered a desert .
It has yearly precipitation of only 200 mm ( 8 inches ) near the sea and far less inland .
No humans live in Antarctica permanently .
However , about 1,000 to 5,000 people live through the year at the science stations in Antarctica .
Only plants and animals that can live in cold live there .
The animals include penguins , seals , nematodes , tardigrades and mites .
Plant life includes some grass and shrubs , algae , lichen , fungi , and bacteria .
The first known sighting of the continent was in 1820 .
Antarctica was mostly forgotten for the rest of the 19th century .
This was because of its hostile environment , few resources , and isolation .
The first official use of the name Antarctica as a continental name in the 1890s is said to have been used by Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew .
The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 by 12 countries .
More countries have signed the treaty since then .
So far , 46 countries have signed the treaty .
The treaty declares that military activities and mineral mining are against the law .
However , it supports scientific research .
It also helps the continent 's ecozone .
More than 4,000 scientists from different nations and different interests experiment together .
== Geography and geology ==
Antarctica is covered by an ice sheet about four kilometres thick .
Under the ice it is mostly land , although the ice shelves are over the ocean .
The Transantarctic Mountains divide the land between East Antarctica in the Eastern Hemisphere and West Antarctica in the Western Hemisphere .
Antarctica has some important features hidden by the ice .
One is Lake Vostok , which has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years .
The lake is 250 km long and 50 km wide .
Another is the huge Gamburtsev mountain chain , which are the size of the Alps , yet entirely buried under the ice .
The Gamburtsev range has a nearby massive rift valley similar to the East African Great Rift Valley .
It is called the Lambert system .
Scientists used radar that can work under ice to survey the whole of Antarctica .
== Ancient Antarctica ==
Scientists say Antarctica used to be much further north and much warmer , moving to where it is now through continental drift .
From 2011 to 2013 , scientists collected fossils of frogs , water lilies , and shark and ray teeth , showing that these life forms used to live on Antarctica .
The frog fossils were about 40 million years old .
Scientists say marsupials , animals that keep their babies in pouches , could have started in South America , migrated to a warm ancient Antarctica , and gone to Australia from there .
== Life in Antarctica ==
=== Plants ===
Few land plants grow in Antarctica .
This is because Antarctica does not have much moisture ( water ) , sunlight , good soil , or a warm temperature .
Plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer .
However , moss , lichen and algae do grow .
The most important organisms in Antarctica are the plankton which grow in the ocean .
=== Animals ===
One important source of food in the Antarctic is the krill , which is a general term for the small shrimp-like marine crustaceans .
Krill are near the bottom of the food chain : they feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton .
Krill are a food form suitable for the larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet .
Whales , penguins , seals , and even some of the birds that live in Antarctica , all depend on krill .
Whales are the largest animals in the ocean , and in Antarctica .
They are mammals , not fish .
That means that they breathe air and do not lay eggs .
Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica .
Whalers have hunted whales for hundreds of years , for meat and blubber .
Nowadays most whaling is done in the Antarctic area .
Penguins only live south of the equator .
Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica .
The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet ( 1.2m ) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds ( 40 kg ) .
The smallest kinds are only about one foot ( 30 cm ) tall .
Penguins are large birds that swim very well but can not fly .
They have black backs and wings with white fronts .
Their feathers are very tightly packed and make a thick cover .
They also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers .
The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof .
A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm .
Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean .
They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks .
They nest together in a huge group .
==== Largest land animal ====
The largest animal in Antarctica that lives entirely on land is a wingless midge .
== History of its discovery ==
For a long time , people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth .
They thought this Terra Australis would balance the lands in the north like Europe , Asia and North Africa .
People have believed this from the times of Ptolemy ( 1st century AD ) .
He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world .
Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps .
In the late 17th century , people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the mythical Antarctica .
However , geographers still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was .
European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain James Cook 's ships , HMS Resolution and Adventure , crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773 , in December 1773 .
They crossed it again in January 1774 .
In fact , Cook did come within about 75 miles ( 121 km ) of the Antarctic coast .
However , he was forced to go back because of ice in January 1773.The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica were by three different men .
According to different organizations , ships captained by three men saw Antarctica in 1820 .
The three men were Fabian von Bellingshausen ( a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy ) , Edward Bransfield ( a captain in the Royal Navy ) , and Nathaniel Palmer ( an American seal hunter out of Stonington , Connecticut ) .
The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis .
He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821 .
However , some historians are not sure about this claim .
People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them .
This was slow work because they could only work in the summer .
At last a map was made , and people began to talk about exploring the land , not only the sea .
However , this would have been very hard work .
They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica .
Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land .
The first serious exploration of the Antarctic land was the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907â€“09 .
They were the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole .
Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 February 1909 .
They were the first humans to cross the Ross Ice Shelf , and the Transantarctic Mountain Range ( via the Beardmore Glacier ) .
They were the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau .
Robert Falcon Scott , the most well known of all of the explorers , wanted to be the first man to reach the South Pole .
At the same time , another team from Norway lead by Roald Amundsen started .
They both raced each other to the South Pole , but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs .
Scott had used ponies and motor sleds , but when he got to the South Pole he found a message from Amundsen , showing that he had beaten Scott .
On his way back , Scott and three companions met a blizzard and froze to death while waiting for it to finish .
The people who found him eight months later also found his records and diary , which he had written to the day he died .
Climate change and global warming are showing effects in Antarctica , particularly the Antarctic Peninsula .
=== People ===
No one lives in Antarctica all the time .
People who go to Antarctica are there to learn about Antarctica , so most of the people who live there are scientists .
Most live at national science stations on the coast .
Some bases are far from the sea , for example at the South pole .
They study the weather , animals , glaciers , and the Earth 's atmosphere .
Some scientists drill ice cores to find out about the weather long ago .
People who work in the Antarctic must be careful , because a blizzard can start any time and anywhere .
When they go far away from their shelter , they must always take lots of food just in case .
Today , people explore Antarctica using snowmobiles , which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads .
Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit .
There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antarctica , so people pay to go there on a ship .
Some people take their own boats .
