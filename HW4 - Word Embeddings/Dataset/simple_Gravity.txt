Gravity , or gravitation is one of the fundamental forces of the universe .
In this article , we discuss it in three parts : Everyday sense : the force which causes objects to fall to the ground Newton 's laws : how gravity keeps the Solar System and most major astronomical objects together Einstein 's theory of general relativity : the role of gravity in the universeSome physicists think gravity is caused by gravitons , but they are still unsure .
== Everyday gravity ==
=== Weight vs mass ===
In everyday talk , we say things fall because the Earth 's gravity pulls on them .
We talk as if our weight was a given .
Actually , weight changes when the pull of gravity changes .
The Moon is much smaller and the pull of gravity on the Moon is about 1/6th that of Earth .
So any object on the Moon weighs 1/6th of its weight on Earth .
What does not change is the amount of matter in an object .
That is called conservation of mass .
On Earth , mass and weight are the same for most purposes , though a sensitive gravimeter can detect the difference .
The difference can be very different on another world such as the Moon .
From this we learn two things .
The weight of an object is variable ; its mass is constant .
The pull of gravity varies according to the mass of an object .
The Earth pulls more strongly than the Moon .
A person also exerts a gravitational pull , but it is so tiny it can be ignored for all practical purposes.The Earth has mass .
Every particle of matter has mass .
So the Earth pulls on every object and person , and they pull on the Earth .
This pulling force is called gravity and it gives weight .
=== Gravity vs gravitation ===
These words mean almost the same thing in everyday use .
Sometimes scientists use gravity for the force that pulls objects towards each other , and gravitation for the theory about the attraction .
== History of gravitational theory ==
=== Galileo ===
According to one of his students , Galileo did a famous experiment about gravity where he dropped balls from the Tower of Pisa .
He later rolled balls down inclines .
With these experiments , Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate regardless of weight .
=== Kepler ===
Johannes Kepler studied the motion of planets .
In 1609 and 1616 he published his three laws governing the shape of their orbits and their speed along those orbits , but did not discover why they moved that way .
=== Newton ===
In 1687 , English mathematician Isaac Newton wrote the Principia .
In this book , he wrote about the inverse-square law of gravitation .
Newton , following an idea that had long been discussed by others , said that the closer two objects are to each other , the more gravity will affect them .
Newton 's laws were used later to predict the existence of the planet Neptune based on changes in the orbit of Uranus , and again to predict the existence of another planet closer to the Sun than Mercury .
When this was done , it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct .
These mistakes in his theory were corrected by Albert Einstein 's theory of General Relativity .
Newton 's theory is still commonly used for many things because it is simpler and is accurate enough for many uses .
=== Dynamic equilibrium ===
Why does the Earth not fall into the Sun
The answer is simple but very important .
It is because the Earth moving round the Sun is in a dynamic equilibrium .
The speed of the Earth 's movement creates a centrifugal force which balances the gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth .
Why does the Earth continue spinning
Because there is no force to stop it .
Newton 's first law : If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in motion it moves at the same speed until it is acted on by an external force is a kind of analogy between centrifugal force and gravitational force , which led to the equivalence principle of general relativity .
==== Weightlessness ====
In free fall an object 's motion balances out the pull of gravity on it .
This includes being in orbit .
== General relativity ==
The special theory of relativity describes systems where gravity is not an issue ; by contrast , gravity is the central issue of the general theory of relativity.In general relativity there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural , straight paths .
Instead , gravity is seen as changes in the properties of space and time .
In turn , this changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow .
The curvature is , in turn , caused by the energy–momentum of matter .
Spacetime tells matter how to move ; matter tells spacetime how to curve.For weak gravitational fields and slow speeds relative to the speed of light , the theory 's predictions converge on those of Newton 's law of universal gravitation .
Newton 's equations are used to plan journeys in our Solar System .
General relativity has a number of physical consequences .
=== Time dilation and frequency shift ===
Gravity influences the passage of time .
Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted , whereas light sent in the opposite direction ( i.e. , climbing out of the gravity well ) is redshifted ; collectively , these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift .
More generally , processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away ; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation .
=== Light deflection and gravitational time delay ===
General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field ; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body .
This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay ( or Shapiro delay ) , the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field .
There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction.A parameter called γ encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space .
=== Gravitational waves ===
Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime .
They move as a wave , travelling outward from the source .
Einstein predicted them in 1915 on the basis of his theory of general relativity .
In theory , gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation .
Sources of detectable gravitational waves might include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes .
In general relativity , gravitational waves can not travel faster than the speed of light .
The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary star system .
These measurements suggested gravitational waves are more than mathematical peculiarities .
On February 11 , 2016 , the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration teams announced that they had made the first observation of gravitational waves , originating from a pair of merging black holes using the Advanced LIGO detectors .
On June 15 , 2016 , a second detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes was announced .
Besides LIGO , many other gravitational-wave observatories ( detectors ) are under construction .
