== History ==
Wikipedia began as a related project for Nupedia .
Nupedia was a free online English-language encyclopedia project .
Nupedia 's articles were written and owned by Bomis , Inc which was a web portal company .
The main people of the company were Jimmy Wales , the guy in charge of Bomis , and Larry Sanger , the editor-in-chief for Nupedia .
Nupedia was first licensed under the Nupedia Open Content License which was changed to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia was founded and made their first article when Richard Stallman requested them.Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales are the ones who started Wikipedia .
Wales is credited with defining the goals of the project .
Sanger created the strategy of using a wiki to reach Wales ' goal .
On January 10 , 2001 , Larry Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for Nupedia .
Wikipedia was launched on January 15 , 2001 .
It was launched as an English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com , and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list .
Wikipedia 's policy of neutral point-of-view was codified in its initial months , and was similar to Nupedia 's earlier nonbiased policy .
Otherwise , there were not very many rules initially , and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia , Slashdot , and also from search engines .
It grew to about 20,000 articles , and 18 languages by the end of 2001 .
By late 2002 it had 26 languages , 46 by the end of 2003 , and 161 by the end of 2004 .
Nupedia and Wikipedia both existed until Nupedia 's servers were stopped in 2003 .
After this , its text was incorporated into Wikipedia .
The English Wikipedia passed the 2 million-article mark on September 9 , 2007 , making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled , even larger than the Yongle Encyclopedia ( 1407 ) , which had held the record for exactly 600 years.The English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009 .
The numbers of articles and contributors appeared to be growing less quickly around spring 2007.In October 2014 , the Wikipedia Monument was unveiled to the public in Poland to honor all the contributors of the Wikipedia .
According to TechCrunch website , on 23 January 2020 , Wikipedia had surpassed more than 6 million articles on the English Wikipedia .
