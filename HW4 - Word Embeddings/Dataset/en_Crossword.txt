A crossword is a word puzzle and word search game that usually takes the form of a square or a rectangular grid of white- and black-shaded squares .
The game 's goal is to fill the white squares with letters , forming words or phrases , by solving clues , which lead to the answers .
In languages that are written left-to-right , the answer words and phrases are placed in the grid from left to right and from top to bottom .
The shaded squares are used to separate the words or phrases .
== Types ==
Crossword grids such as those appearing in most North American newspapers and magazines feature solid areas of white squares .
Every letter is checked ( i.e .
is part of both an across word and a down word ) and usually each answer must contain at least three letters .
In such puzzles shaded squares are typically limited to about one-sixth of the total .
Crossword grids elsewhere , such as in Britain , South Africa , India and Australia , have a lattice-like structure , with a higher percentage of shaded squares ( around 25 ) , leaving about half the letters in an answer unchecked .
For example , if the top row has an answer running all the way across , there will often be no across answers in the second row .
Another tradition in puzzle design ( in North America , India , and Britain particularly ) is that the grid should have 180-degree rotational ( also known as radial ) symmetry , so that its pattern appears the same if the paper is turned upside down .
Most puzzle designs also require that all white cells be orthogonally contiguous ( that is , connected in one mass through shared sides , to form a single polyomino ) .
The design of Japanese crossword grids often follows two additional rules : that shaded cells may not share a side ( i.e .
they may not be orthogonally contiguous ) and that the corner squares must be white .
The Swedish-style grid ( picture crosswords ) uses no clue numbers , as the clues are contained in the cells which do not contain answers .
Arrows indicate in which direction the clues have to be answered : vertical or horizontal .
This style of grid is also used in several countries other than Sweden , often in magazines , but also in daily newspapers .
The grid often has one or more photos replacing a block of squares as a clue to one or several answers , for example , the name of a pop star , or some kind of rhyme or phrase that can be associated with the photo .
These puzzles usually have no symmetry in the grid but instead often have a common theme ( literature , music , nature , geography , events of a special year , etc . )
Substantial variants from the usual forms exist .
Two of the common ones are barred crosswords , which use bold lines between squares ( instead of shaded squares ) to separate answers , and circular designs , with answers entered either radially or in concentric circles .
Free form crosswords ( criss-cross puzzles ) , which have simple , asymmetric designs , are often seen on school worksheets , children 's menus , and other entertainment for children .
Grids forming shapes other than squares are also occasionally used .
Puzzles are often one of several standard sizes .
For example , many weekday newspaper puzzles ( such as the American New York Times crossword puzzle ) are 15×15 squares , while weekend puzzles may be 21×21 , 23×23 , or 25×25 .
The New York Times puzzles also set a common pattern for American crosswords by increasing in difficulty throughout the week : their Monday puzzles are the easiest and the puzzles get harder each day until Saturday .
Their larger Sunday puzzle is about the same level of difficulty as a weekday-size Thursday puzzle .
This has led U.S. solvers to use the day of the week as a shorthand when describing how hard a puzzle is : e.g .
an easy puzzle may be referred to as a Monday or a Tuesday , a medium-difficulty puzzle as a Wednesday , and a truly difficult puzzle as a Saturday .
One of the smallest crosswords in general distribution is a 4×4 crossword compiled daily by John Wilmes , distributed online by USA Today as QuickCross and by Universal Uclick as PlayFour .
Typically clues appear outside the grid , divided into an Across list and a Down list ; the first cell of each entry contains a number referenced by the clue lists .
For example , the answer to a clue labeled 17 Down is entered with the first letter in the cell numbered 17 , proceeding down from there .
Numbers are almost never repeated ; numbered cells are numbered consecutively , usually from left to right across each row , starting with the top row and proceeding downward .
Some Japanese crosswords are numbered from top to bottom down each column , starting with the leftmost column and proceeding right .
== Clues : conventions and types == === Capitalization ===
Capitalization of answer letters is conventionally ignored ; crossword puzzles are typically filled in , and their answer sheets are almost universally published , in all caps , except in the rare cases of ambigrams .
This ensures a proper name can have its initial capital letter checked with a non-capitalizable letter in the intersecting clue .
=== Straight or quick ===
Some crossword clues , called straight or quick clues , are simple definitions of the answers .
Some clues may feature anagrams , and these are usually explicitly described as such .
Often , a straight clue is not in itself sufficient to distinguish between several possible answers , either because multiple synonymous answers may fit or because the clue itself is a homonym ( e.g. , Lead as in to be ahead in a contest or Lead as in the element ) , so the solver must make use of checks to establish the correct answer with certainty .
For example , the answer to the clue PC key for a three-letter answer could be ESC , ALT , TAB , DEL , or INS , so until a check is filled in , giving at least one of the letters , the correct answer can not be determined .
In most American-style crosswords , the majority of the clues in the puzzle are straight clues , with the remainder being one of the other types described below .
Crossword clues are generally consistent with the solutions .
For instance , clues and their solutions should always agree in tense , number , and degree .
If a clue is in the past tense , so is the answer : thus Traveled on horseback would be a valid clue for the solution RODE , but not for RIDE .
Similarly , Family members would be a valid clue for AUNTS but not UNCLE , while More joyful could clue HAPPIER but not HAPPIEST .
Some clue examples : Fill-in-the-blank clues are often the easiest in a puzzle and a good place to start solving , e.g. , _____ Boleyn = ANNE .
Before and after clues feature one word that is part of two phrases , often designated with parentheses and brackets , e.g. , ( Doing [ ____ ) keeper ] = TIME .
A question mark at the end of clue usually signals that the clue/answer combination involves some sort of pun or wordplay , e.g. , Grateful
= ASHES , since a grate might be full of them .
Most widely distributed American crosswords today ( e.g. , The New York Times , The Washington Post , The Boston Globe , USA Today , The American Values Club Crossword , etc . )
also contain colloquial answers , i.e. , entries in the puzzle grid that try to replicate everyday colloquial language .
In such a puzzle one might see phrases such as WHAT 'S UP , AS IF , or WHADDYA WANT .
=== Abbreviations ===
The constraints of the American-style grid ( in which every letter is checked ) often require a fair number of answers not to be dictionary words .
As a result , the following ways to clue abbreviations and other non-words , although they can be found in straight British crosswords , are much more common in American ones : Abbreviations , the use of a foreign language , variant spellings , or other unusual word tricks are indicated in the clue .
A crossword creator might choose to clue the answer SEN ( as in the abbreviation for senator ) as Washington bigwig : Abbr .
or Member of Cong .
, with the abbreviation in the clue indicating that the answer is to be similarly abbreviated .
The use of Var .
indicates the answer is a variant spelling ( e.g. , EMEER instead of EMIR ) , while the use of foreign language or a foreign place name within the clue indicates that the answer is also in a foreign language .
For example , ETE ( été , French for summer ) might be clued as Summer , in the Sorbonne .
ROMA could be clued as Italia 's capital , whereas the clue Italy 's capital would indicate the English spelling Rome .
The eight possible abbreviations for a position on a compass , e.g. , NNW ( north-northwest ) or ESE ( east-southeast ) , occur with some frequency .
They can be clued as simply Compass point , where the desired answer is determined by a combination of logic—since the third letter can be only E or W , and the second letter can be only N or S—and a process of elimination using checks .
Alternatively , compass point answers are more frequently clued as XXX to YYY direction , where XXX and YYY are two place names .
For example , SSW might be clued as New York to Washington DC dir .
Similarly , a clue such as Right on the map means EAST .
A clue could also consist of objects that point a direction , e.g. , vane dir .
or windsock dir . .
Roman numerals , and arithmetic involving them , frequently appear as well ; the clue IV times III ( 4×3 ) would yield XII ( 12 ) .
In addition , partial answers are allowed in American-style crosswords , where the answer represents part of a longer phrase .
For example , the clue Mind your _____ Qs gives the answer PSAND ( Ps and ) .
Non-dictionary phrases are also allowed in answers .
Thus , the clue Mocked could result in the grid entry LAUGHED AT .
=== Themes ===
Many American crossword puzzles feature a theme consisting of a number of long entries ( generally three to five in a standard 15×15-square weekday-size puzzle ) that share some relationship , type of pun , or other element in common .
As an example , the New York Times crossword of April 26 , 2005 by Sarah Keller , edited by Will Shortz , featured five themed entries ending in the different parts of a tree : SQUAREROOT , TABLELEAF , WARDROBETRUNK , BRAINSTEM , and BANKBRANCH .
The above is an example of a category theme , where the theme elements are all members of the same set .
Other types of themes include : Quote themes , featuring a famous quote broken up into parts to fit in the grid ( and usually clued as Quote , part 1 , Quote , part 2 , etc . )
Rebus themes , where multiple letters or even symbols occupy a single square in the puzzle ( e.g. , BERMUDAΔ ) Addition themes , where theme entries are created by adding a letter , letters , or word ( s ) to an existing word or phrase .
For example , Crucial pool shot
= CRITICAL MASSE ( formed by taking the phrase critical mass and adding an e on the end .
All the theme entries in a given puzzle must be formed by the same process ( so another entry might be Greco-Roman buddy
= WRESTLING MATE— wrestling mat with an e added on ) .
An example of a multiple-letter addition ( and one that does not occur at the end of the entry ) might be Crazy about kitchen storage
= CABINET FEVER ( derived from cabin fever ) .
Subtraction themes , the reverse of the above , where letters are removed to make a new word or phrase .
Compound themes , where the starts or ends of the theme entries can all precede or follow another word , which is given elsewhere in the puzzle .
For example , a puzzle with theme entries that begin with PAPER , BALL , and WATER and elsewhere in the puzzle , the word BOY clued as Word that can follow the start of [ theme entries ] .
Anniversary or tribute themes , commemorating a specific person , place , or event .
For example , on October 7 , 2011 The New York Times crossword commemorated the life of Apple CEO Steve Jobs who had died on October 5 .
Theme entries related to Jobs ' life included MACINTOSH , PIXAR , THINK DIFFERENT , CREATIVE GENIUS , STEVE JOBS , and APPLE .
Synonym themes , where the theme entries all contain synonyms , e.g. , a Los Angeles Times puzzle featuring a set of theme entries that contain the words RAVEN , JET , EBONY , and SABLE , all synonyms for black Numerous other types have been identified , including spoonerisms , poems , shifted letters , rhyming phrases , puns , homophones , and combinations of two or more of other types of themes.The Simon Schuster Crossword Puzzle Series has published many unusual themed crosswords .
Rosetta Stone , by Sam Bellotto , incorporates a Caesar cipher cryptogram as the theme ; the key to breaking the cipher is the answer to 1 Across .
Another unusual theme requires the solver to use the answer to a clue as another clue .
The answer to that clue is the real solution .
=== Indirect clues ===
Many puzzles feature clues involving wordplay which are to be taken metaphorically or in some sense other than their literal meaning , requiring some form of lateral thinking .
Depending on the puzzle creator or the editor , this might be represented either with a question mark at the end of the clue or with a modifier such as maybe or perhaps .
In more difficult puzzles , the indicator may be omitted , increasing ambiguity between a literal meaning and a wordplay meaning .
Examples : Half a dance could clue CAN ( half of CANCAN ) or CHA ( half of CHACHA ) .
If taken literally , Start of spring could clue MAR ( for March ) , but it could also clue ESS , the spelled-out form of the starting letter Nice summer
clues ETE , summer in Nice , France ( été being French for summer ) , rather than a nice ( pleasant ) summer .
This clue also takes advantage of the fact that in American-style crosswords , the initial letter of a clue is always capitalized , whether or not it is a proper noun .
In this clue , the initial capitalization further obscures whether the clue is referring to nice as in pleasant or Nice as in the French city .
Pay addition , taken literally , clues BONUS .
When taken as an indirect clue , however , it could also clue OLA ( the addition of -ola to pay- results in PAYOLA ) .
=== Cryptic crosswords ===
In cryptic crosswords , the clues are puzzles in themselves .
A typical clue contains both a definition at the beginning or end of the clue and wordplay , which provides a way to manufacture the word indicated by the definition , and which may not parse logically .
Cryptics usually give the length of their answers in parentheses after the clue , which is especially useful with multi-word answers .
Certain signs indicate different forms of wordplay .
Solving cryptics is harder to learn than standard crosswords , as learning to interpret the different types of cryptic clues can take some practice .
In Great Britain and throughout much of the Commonwealth , cryptics of varying degrees of difficulty are featured in many newspapers .
There are several types of wordplay used in cryptics .
One is straightforward definition substitution using parts of a word .
For example , in one puzzle by Mel Taub , the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue To bring worker into the country may prove significant .
The explanation is that to import means to bring into the country , the worker is a worker ant , and significant means important .
Here , significant is the straight definition ( appearing here at the end of the clue ) , to bring worker into the country is the wordplay definition , and may prove serves to link the two .
Note that in a cryptic clue , there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay , so that when one sees the answer , one knows that it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out why it is the right answer .
A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer , while at the same time being deliberately misleading .
Another type of wordplay used in cryptics is the use of homophones .
For example , the clue A few , we hear , add up ( 3 ) is the clue for SUM .
The straight definition is add up , meaning totalize .
The solver must guess that we hear indicates a homophone , and so a homophone of a synonym of A few ( some ) is the answer .
Other words relating to sound or hearing can be used to signal the presence of a homophone clue ( e.g. , aloud , audibly , in conversation , etc . ) .
The double meaning is commonly used as another form of wordplay .
For example , Cat 's tongue ( 7 ) is solved by PERSIAN , since this is a type of cat , as well as a tongue , or language .
This is the only type of cryptic clue without wordplay—both parts of the clue are a straight definition .
Cryptics often include anagrams , as well .
The clue Ned 's seal cooked is rather bland ( 5,4 ) is solved by NEEDS SALT .
The straight definition is is rather bland , and the word cooked is a hint to the solver that this clue is an anagram ( the letters have been cooked , or jumbled up ) .
Ignoring all punctuation , Ned 's seal is an anagram for NEEDS SALT .
Besides cooked , other common hints that the clue contains an anagram are words such as scrambled , mixed up , confused , baked , or twisted .
Embedded words are another common trick in cryptics .
The clue Bigotry aside , I 'd take him ( 9 ) is solved by APARTHEID .
The straight definition is bigotry , and the wordplay explains itself , indicated by the word take ( since one word takes another ) : aside means APART and I 'd is simply ID , so APART and ID take HE ( which is , in cryptic crossword usage , a perfectly good synonym for him ) .
The answer could be elucidated as APART ( HE ) ID .
Another common clue type is the hidden clue or container , where the answer is hidden in the text of the clue itself .
For example , Made a dug-out , buried , and passed away ( 4 ) is solved by DEAD .
The answer is written in the clue : maDE A Dug-out .
Buried indicates that the answer is embedded within the clue .
There are numerous other forms of wordplay found in cryptic clues .
Backwards words can be indicated by words like climbing , retreating , or ascending ( depending on whether it is an across clue or a down clue ) or by directional indicators such as going North ( meaning upwards ) or West ( right-to-left ) ; letters can be replaced or removed with indicators such as nothing rather than excellence ( meaning replace E in a word with O ) ; the letter I can be indicated by me or one ; the letter O can be indicated by nought , nothing , zero , or a ring ( since it visually resembles one ) ; the letter X might be clued as a cross , or ten ( as in the Roman numeral ) , or an illiterate 's signature , or sounds like your old flame ( homophone for ex ) .
Senselessness is solved by e , because e is what remains after removing ( less ) ness from sense .
With the different types of wordplay and definition possibilities , the composer of a cryptic puzzle is presented with many different possible ways to clue a given answer .
Most desirable are clues that are clean but deceptive , with a smooth surface reading ( that is , the resulting clue looks as natural a phrase as possible ) .
The Usenet newsgroup rec.puzzles.crosswords has a number of clueing competitions where contestants all submit clues for the same word and a judge picks the best one .
In principle , each cryptic clue is usually sufficient to define its answer uniquely , so it should be possible to answer each clue without use of the grid .
In practice , the use of checks is an important aid to the solver .
=== Metapuzzles ===
Some crossword designers have started including a metapuzzle , or meta for short : a second puzzle within the completed puzzle .
After the player has correctly solved the crossword puzzle in the usual fashion , the solution forms the basis of a second puzzle .
The designer usually includes a hint to the metapuzzle .
For instance , the puzzle Eight Is n't Enough by Matt Gaffney gives the clue This week 's contest answer is a three-word phrase whose second word is 'or ' .
The crossword solution includes the entries BROUGHT TO NAUGHT , MIGHT MAKES RIGHT , CAUGHT A STRAIGHT , and HEIGHT AND WEIGHT , which are all three-word phrases with two words ending in -ght .
The solution to the meta is a similar phrase in which the middle word is or : FIGHT OR FLIGHT .
=== Schrödinger or quantum puzzles ===
Some puzzle grids contain more than one correct answer for the same set of clues .
These are called Schrödinger or quantum puzzles , alluding to the Schrödinger 's Cat thought experiment in quantum physics .
Schrödinger puzzles have frequently been published in venues including Fireball Crosswords and The American Values Club Crosswords , and at least ten have appeared in The New York Times since the late 1980s .
The daily New York Times puzzle for November 5 , 1996 , by Jeremiah Farrell , had a clue for 39 Across that read Lead story in tomorrow 's newspaper , with 43 Across .
The answer for 43 Across was ELECTED ; depending on the outcome of that day 's Presidential Election , the answer for 39 Across would have been correct with either CLINTON or BOBDOLE , as would each of the corresponding Down answers .
On September 1 , 2016 , the daily New York Times puzzle by Ben Tausig had four squares which led to correct answers reading both across and down if solvers entered either M or The puzzle 's theme , GENDERFLUID , was revealed at 37 Across in the center of the puzzle : Having a variable identity , as suggested by four squares in this puzzle .
=== The first entries ===
In the 'Quick ' crossword in The Daily Telegraph newspaper ( Sunday and Daily , UK ) , it has become a convention also to make the first few words ( usually two or three , but can be more ) into a phrase .
For example , Dimmer , Allies would make Demoralise or You , ill , never , walk , alone would become You 'll never walk alone .
This generally aids solvers in that if they have one of the words then they can attempt to guess the phrase .
This has also become popular among other British newspapers .
=== Double clue lists ===
Sometimes newspapers publish one grid that can be filled by solving either of two lists of clues—usually a straight and a cryptic .
The solutions given by the two lists may be different , in which case the solver must decide at the outset which list they are going to follow , or the solutions may be identical , in which case the straight clues offer additional help for a solver having difficulty with the cryptic clues .
For example , the solution APARTHEID might be clued as Bigotry aside , I 'd take him ( 9 ) in the cryptic list , and Racial separation ( 9 ) in the straight list .
Usually the straight clue matches the straight part of the cryptic clue , but this is not necessarily the case .
Every issue of GAMES Magazine contains a large crossword with a double clue list , under the title The World 's Most Ornery Crossword ; both lists are straight and arrive at the same solution , but one list is significantly more challenging than the other .
The solver is prompted to fold a page in half , showing the grid and the hard clues ; the easy clues are tucked inside the fold , to be referenced if the solver gets stuck .
A variant of the double-clue list is commonly called Siamese Twins : two matching grids are provided , and the two clue lists are merged such that the two clues for each entry are displayed together in random order .
Determining which clue is to be applied to which grid is part of the puzzle .
=== Other clue variations ===
Any type of puzzle may contain cross-references , where the answer to one clue forms part of another clue , in which it is referred to by number and direction .
E.g. , a puzzle might have 1-Across clued as Central character in The Lord of the Rings = FRODO , with 17-Down clued as Precious object for 1-Across = RING .
When an answer is composed of multiple or hyphenated words , some crosswords ( especially in Britain ) indicate the structure of the answer .
For example , ( 3,5 ) after a clue indicates that the answer is composed of a three-letter word followed by a five-letter word .
Most American-style crosswords do not provide this information .
== Major variants ==
These are common crossword variants that vary more from a regular crossword than just an unusual grid shape or unusual clues ; these crossword variants may be based on different solving principles and require a different solving skill set .
=== Cipher crosswords ===
Cipher crosswords were invented in Germany in the 19th century .
Published under various trade names ( including Code Breakers , Code Crackers , and Kaidoku ) , and not to be confused with cryptic crosswords ( ciphertext puzzles are commonly known as cryptograms ) , a cipher crossword replaces the clues for each entry with clues for each white cell of the grid—an integer from 1 to 26 inclusive is printed in the corner of each .
The objective , as any other crossword , is to determine the proper letter for each cell ; in a cipher crossword , the 26 numbers serve as a cipher for those letters : cells that share matching numbers are filled with matching letters , and no two numbers stand for the same letter .
All resultant entries must be valid words .
Usually , at least one number 's letter is given at the outset .
English-language cipher crosswords are nearly always pangrammatic ( all letters of the alphabet appear in the solution ) .
As these puzzles are closer to codes than quizzes , they require a different skillset ; many basic cryptographic techniques , such as determining likely vowels , are key to solving these .
Given their pangrammaticity , a frequent start point is locating where ' Q ' and ' U ' must appear .
=== Diagramless crosswords ===
In a diagramless crossword , often called a diagramless for short or , in the UK , a skeleton crossword or carte blanche , the grid offers overall dimensions , but the locations of most of the clue numbers and shaded squares are unspecified .
A solver must deduce not only the answers to individual clues , but how to fit together partially built-up clumps of answers into larger clumps with properly set shaded squares .
Some of these puzzles follow the traditional symmetry rule , others have left-right mirror symmetry , and others have greater levels of symmetry or outlines suggesting other shapes .
If the symmetry of the grid is given , the solver can use it to his/her advantage .
A variation is the Blankout puzzle in the Daily Mail Weekend magazine .
The clues are not individually numbered , but given in terms of the rows and columns of the grid , which has rectangular symmetry .
The list of clues gives hints of the locations of some of the shaded squares even before one starts solving them , e.g .
there must be a shaded square where a row having no clues intersects a column having no clues .
=== Fill-in crosswords === A fill-in crossword ( also known as crusadex or cruzadex ) features a grid and the full list of words to be entered in that grid , but does not give explicit clues for where each word goes .
The challenge is figuring out how to integrate the list of words together within the grid so that all intersections of words are valid .
Fill-in crosswords may often have longer word length than regular crosswords to make the crossword easier to solve , and symmetry is often disregarded .
Fitting together several long words is easier than fitting together several short words because there are fewer possibilities for how the long words intersect together .
These types of crosswords are also used to demonstrate artificial intelligence abilities , such as finding solutions to the puzzle based on a set of determined constraints .
=== Crossnumbers ===
A crossnumber ( also known as a cross-figure ) is the numerical analogy of a crossword , in which the solutions to the clues are numbers instead of words .
Clues are usually arithmetical expressions , but can also be general knowledge clues to which the answer is a number or year .
There are also numerical fill-in crosswords .
The Daily Mail Weekend magazine used to feature crossnumbers under the misnomer Number Word .
This kind of puzzle should not be confused with a different puzzle that the Daily Mail refers to as Cross Number .
=== Acrostic puzzles ===
An acrostic is a type of word puzzle , in eponymous acrostic form , that typically consists of two parts .
The first is a set of lettered clues , each of which has numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer .
The second part is a long series of numbered blanks and spaces , representing a quotation or other text , into which the answers for the clues fit .
In most forms of the puzzle , the first letters of each correct clue answer , read in order from clue A on down the list , will spell out the author of the quote and the title of the work it is taken from ; this can be used as an additional solving aid .
=== Arroword ===
The arroword is a variant of a crossword that does not have as many black squares as a true crossword , but has arrows inside the grid , with clues preceding the arrows .
It has been called the most popular word puzzle in many European countries , and is often called the Scandinavian crossword , as it is believed to have originated in Sweden .
== History ==
Following the invention of the crossword puzzle in late 19th century Japan , such puzzles were included in The Stockton Bee ( 1793–1795 ) , an ephemeral publication .
The phrase cross word puzzle was first written in 1862 by Our Young Folks in the United States .
Crossword-like puzzles , for example Double Diamond Puzzles , appeared in the magazine Nicholas , published since 1873 .
Another crossword puzzle appeared on September 14 , 1890 , in the Italian magazine Il Secolo Illustrato della Domenica .
It was designed by Giuseppe Airoldi and titled Per passare il tempo ( To pass the time ) .
Airoldi 's puzzle was a four-by-four grid with no shaded squares ; it included horizontal and vertical clues.Crosswords in England during the 19th century were of an elementary kind , apparently derived from the word square , a group of words arranged so the letters read alike vertically and horizontally , and printed in children 's puzzle books and various periodicals .
On December 21 , 1913 , Arthur Wynne , a journalist from Liverpool , England , published a word-cross puzzle in the New York World that embodied most of the features of the modern genre .
This puzzle is frequently cited as the first crossword puzzle , and Wynne as the inventor .
An illustrator later reversed the word-cross name to cross-word.Crossword puzzles became a regular weekly feature in the New York World , and spread to other newspapers ; the Pittsburgh Press , for example , was publishing them at least as early as 1916 and The Boston Globe by 1917 .
By the 1920s , the crossword phenomenon was starting to attract notice .
In October 1922 , newspapers published a comic strip by Clare Briggs entitled Movie of a Man Doing the Cross-Word Puzzle , with an enthusiast muttering 87 across 'Northern Sea Bird '
Hm-m-m starts with an 'M ' , second letter is ' U '
I 'll look up all the words starting with an 'M-U ' mus-musi-mur-murd—Hot Dog
Here 't is
Murre
In 1923 a humorous squib in The Boston Globe has a wife ordering her husband to run out and rescue the papers the part I want is blowing down the street .
What is it you 're so keen about
The Cross-Word Puzzle .
Hurry , please , that 's a good boy .
In The New Yorker 's first issue , released in 1925 , the Jottings About Town section wrote , Judging from the number of solvers in the subway and L trains , the crossword puzzle bids fair to become a fad with New Yorkers .
In 1925 , the New York Public Library reported that The latest craze to strike libraries is the crossword puzzle , and complained that when the puzzle 'fans ' swarm to the dictionaries and encyclopedias so as to drive away readers and students who need these books in their daily work , can there be any doubt of the Library 's duty to protect its legitimate readers
The first book of crossword puzzles was published by Simon Schuster in 1924 , after a suggestion from co-founder Richard Simon 's aunt .
The publisher was initially skeptical that the book would succeed , and only printed a small run at first .
The book was promoted with an included pencil , and This odd-looking book with a pencil attached to it was an instant hit , leading crossword puzzles to become a craze of 1924 .
To help promote its books , Simon Schuster also founded the Amateur Cross Word Puzzle League of America , which began the process of developing standards for puzzle design.The crossword puzzle fad received extensive attention , not all of it positive : In 1924 , The New York Times complained of the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern , more or less complex .
This is not a game at all , and it hardly can be called a sport [ solvers ] get nothing out of it except a primitive form of mental exercise , and success or failure in any given attempt is equally irrelevant to mental development .
A clergyman called the working of crossword puzzles the mark of a childish mentality and said , There is no use for persons to pretend that working one of the puzzles carries any intellectual value with it . .
However , another wrote a complete Bible Cross-Word Puzzle Book .
Also in 1925 , Time Magazine noted that nine Manhattan dailies and fourteen other big newspapers were carrying crosswords , and quoted opposing views as to whether This crossword craze will positively end by June
or The crossword puzzle is here to stay
In 1925 , The New York Times noted , with approval , a scathing critique of crosswords by The New Republic ; but concluded that Fortunately , the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer .
The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten .
and in 1929 declared , The cross-word puzzle , it seems , has gone the way of all fads In 1930 , a correspondent noted that Together with The Times of London , yours is the only journal of prominence that has never succumbed to the lure of the cross-word puzzle and said that The craze—the fad—stage has passed , but there are still people numbering it to the millions who look for their daily cross-word puzzle as regularly as for the weather predictions .
The term crossword first appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1933.The New York Times began to publish a crossword puzzle on 15 February 1942 , spurred on by the idea that the puzzle could be a welcome distraction from the harsh news of World War II .
The New York Times 's first puzzle editor was Margeret Petherbridge Farrar , who was editor from 1942 to 1969 .
She was succeeded by Will Weng , who was succeeded by Eugene Maleska .
Since 1993 , they have been edited by Will Shortz , the fourth crossword editor in Times .
In 1978 Shortz founded and still directs the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament .
However , a number of other high-profile puzzles have since emerged in the United States in particular , many of which rival the Times in quality and prestige .
These include The New Yorker , The Washington Post , The Wall Street Journal , Brendan Emmett Quigley , The American Values Club , Inkubator Crosswords , and Fireball Crosswords ( the latter four of which are distributed digitally ) .
Simon Schuster continues to publish the Crossword Puzzle Book Series books that it began in 1924 , currently under the editorship of John Samson .
The original series ended in 2007 after 258 volumes .
Since 2008 , these books are now in the Mega series , appearing three times per year and each featuring 300 puzzles .
The British cryptic crossword was imported to the US in 1968 by composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim in New York magazine .
Until 2006 , The Atlantic Monthly regularly featured a cryptic crossword puzzler by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon , which combines cryptic clues with diabolically ingenious variations on the construction of the puzzle itself .
In both cases , no two puzzles are alike in construction , and the intent of the puzzle authors is to entertain with novelty , not to establish new variations of the crossword genre .
In the United Kingdom , the Sunday Express was the first newspaper to publish a crossword on November 2 , 1924 , a Wynne puzzle adapted for the UK .
The first crossword in Britain , according to Tony Augarde in his Oxford Guide to Word Games ( 1984 ) , was in Pearson 's Magazine for February 1922 .
The 2006 documentary Wordplay , about enthusiasts of The New York Times 's puzzle , increased public interest in crosswords .
It highlighted attendees of Will Shortz 's American Crossword Puzzle Tournament , including former American president Bill Clinton and American comedian Jon Stewart .
=== World War II ===
In 1944 , Allied security officers were disturbed by the appearance , in a series of crosswords in The Daily Telegraph , of words that were secret code names for military operations planned as part of Operation Overlord .
Some cryptologists for Bletchley Park were selected after doing well in a crossword-solving competition .
=== Records ===
According to Guinness World Records , May 15 , 2007 , the most prolific crossword compiler is Roger Squires of Ironbridge , Shropshire , UK .
On May 14 , 2007 , he published his 66,666th crossword , equivalent to 2 million clues .
He is one of only four setters to have provided cryptic puzzles to The Times , The Daily Telegraph , The Guardian , the Financial Times and The Independent .
He also holds the record for the longest word ever used in a published crossword—the 58-letter Welsh town Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch clued as an anagram .
Enthusiasts have compiled a number of record-setting achievements in New York Times and other venues .
The lowest word count in a published weekday-size 15x15 puzzle is the June 29 , 2013 The New York Times crossword by Joe Krozel , with just 50 words .
The fewest shaded squares in a 15x15 American crossword is 17 ( leaving 208 white spaces ) , set by the July 27 , 2012 Times crossword by Joe Krozel .
The record for most crosswords published in The New York Times is held by Manny Nosowsky , who has had 241 puzzles in that outlet .
Prahlada Rao , based in Bangalore , has composed/ constructed some 35,000 crossword puzzles in the language Kannada , including 7,500 crosswords based on films made in Kannada , with a total of 1,000,000 ( Ten lakhs ) clues .
His name has recorded in LIMCA BOOK OF RECORDS 2015 for creating highest crosswords in the Indian Regional Languages .
His name has continued in the LIMCA BOOK OF RECORDS 2015 , 2016 and 2017 also .
[ 35 ] === Women crossword constructors ===
Women editors such as Margaret Farrar were influential in the first few decades of puzzle-making , and women constructors such as Bernice Gordon and Elizabeth Gorski have each contributed hundreds of puzzles to The New York Times .
However , in recent years the number of women constructors has declined , and crossword editors at most major papers are all male .
During the years that Will Weng and Eugene Maleska edited the New York Times crossword ( 1969–1993 ) , women constructors accounted for 35 of puzzles , while during the editorship of Will Shortz ( 1993–present ) , this percentage has gone down , with women constructors ( including collaborations ) accounting for only 15 of puzzles in both 2014 and 2015 , 17 of puzzles published in 2016 , 13 lowest in the Shortz Era 2017 , and 16 in 2018 .
Several reasons have been given for the decline in women constructors .
One explanation is that the gender imbalance in crossword construction is similar to that in related fields , such as journalism , and that more freelance male constructors than females submit puzzles on spec to The New York Times and other outlets .
Another explanation is that computer-assisted construction and the increased influence of computational approaches in generating word lists may be making crossword construction more like STEM fields in which women are underrepresented for a number of factors .
However , it has also been argued that this explanation risks propagating myths about gender and technology .
Some have argued that the relative absence of women constructors and editors has had an influence on the content of the puzzles themselves , and that clues and entries can be insensitive regarding language related to gender and race .
Several approaches have been suggested to develop more women in the field , including mentoring novice women constructors and encouraging women constructors to publish their puzzles independently.Crossword venues other than New York Times have recently published higher percentages of women than that puzzle .
In the spring of 2018 , Patti Varol and Amy Reynaldo organized and edited a pack of 18 puzzles constructed by women called Women of Letters .
Inspired by this , Laura Braunstein and Tracy Bennett launched The Inkubator , a twice-monthly subscription service that will publish crosswords constructed by cis women , trans women , and woman-aligned constructors .
The Inkubator raised over 30,000 in its initial Kickstarter campaign , and began publishing puzzles on January 17 , 2019 .
== Non-English languages == Due to the large amount of words ending on a vowel , Italian crossword-makers have perhaps the most difficult task .
The right margin and the bottom can be particularly difficult to put together .
From such a perspective , Swedish crossword-makers have a far easier task .
Especially in the large picture crosswords , both conjugation of verbs and declension of adjectives and nouns are allowed .
A Swedish clue like kan sättas i munnen = sked ( can be put in the mouth = spoon ) can be grammatically changed ; den kan sättas i munnen = skeden ( it can be put in the mouth = the spoon ) , as the definite form of a noun includes declension .
=== Orthography ===
From their origin in New York , crosswords have spread to many countries and languages .
In languages other than English , the status of diacritics varies according to the orthography of the particular language , thus : in Afrikaans all diacritical markings are ignored .
Words such as TEË ( meaning opposed ) and TEE ( meaning tea ) are both simply written TEE .
The same goes for SÊ ( say ) and SE ( belonging to ) and many others .
in Czech and Slovak , diacritics are respected and ch , being considered one letter , occupies one square .
in Dutch crosswords , the ij digraph is considered one letter , filling one square , and the IJ and the Y ( see Dutch alphabet ) are considered distinct .
Rules may vary in other word games .
in Esperanto crosswords , diacritics are respected , as they form separate letters ( graphemes ) in French , in Spanish and in Italian , accent marks and most other diacritical markings are ignored , except the tilde in Spanish : for instance , in French , the final E of answer ÊTRE can double as the final É of CONGÉ when written ETRE and CONGE ; but in Spanish , N and Ñ are distinct letters .
in German language crosswords , the umlauts ä , ö , and ü are dissolved into ae , oe , and ue , and ß is dissolved into ss .
in Hungarian , diacritics are either fully respected , or not respected where it denotes length , that is , , , , are considered the same , but not and which mark different sounds ; although the difference between the short/long pairs of letters is a distinctive feature in Hungarian .
Digraphs fill two squares .
in Irish crosswords , the accents on Á É Í Ó Ú are all respected , so ( for example ) the Í in SÍB can not double as the I in SLIABH .
in Latin , diacritics are ignored .
Therefore , A is considered the same as Ă or Ecclesiastical Latin is normally used .
See the monthly magazine of Latin crosswords Hebdomada aenigmatum as a reference .
in Portuguese , diacritics are ignored with the exception of Ç .
Therefore , A could be checked with Ã or in Romanian , diacritics are ignored .
in Russian , Ё doubles as Е but Й is considered different from И ; the soft sign Ь and the hard sign Ъ occupy a separate square , different from that of the previous letter .
in Spanish crosswords , the digraphs ch and ll fill two squares , although in some old crosswords ( from prior to the 1996 spelling reform ) they filled one square .
=== Grid design , clues , and conventions === French-language crosswords are smaller than English-language ones , and not necessarily square : there are usually 8–13 rows and columns , totaling 81–130 squares .
They need not be symmetric and two-letter words are allowed , unlike in most English-language puzzles .
Compilers strive to minimize use of shaded squares .
A black-square usage of 10 is typical ; Georges Perec compiled many 9×9 grids for Le Point with four or even three black squares .
Rather than numbering the individual clues , the rows and columns are numbered as on a chessboard .
All clues for a given row or column are listed , against its number , as separate sentences .
This is similar to the notation used in the aforementioned Daily Mail Blankout puzzles .
In Italy , crosswords are usually oblong and larger than French ones , 13×21 being a common size .
As in France , they usually are not symmetrical ; two-letter words are allowed ; and the number of shaded squares is minimized .
Nouns ( including surnames ) and the infinitive or past participle of verbs are allowed , as are abbreviations ; in larger crosswords , it is customary to put at the center of the grid phrases made of two to four words , or forenames and surnames .
A variant of Italian crosswords does not use shaded squares : words are delimited by thickening the grid .
Another variant starts with a blank grid : the solver must insert both the answers and the shaded squares , and Across and Down clues are either ordered by row and column or not ordered at all .
Modern Hebrew is normally written with only the consonants ; vowels are either understood , or entered as diacritical marks .
This can lead to ambiguities in the entry of some words , and compilers generally specify that answers are to be entered in ktiv male ( with some vowels ) or ktiv haser ( without vowels ) .
Further , since Hebrew is written from right to left , but Roman numerals are used and written from left to right , there can be an ambiguity in the description of lengths of entries , particularly for multi-word phrases .
Different compilers and publications use differing conventions for both of these issues .
In the Japanese language crossword ; because of the writing system , one syllable ( typically katakana ) is entered into each white cell of the grid rather than one letter , resulting in the typical solving grid seeming small in comparison to those of other languages .
Any second Yōon character is treated as a full syllable and is rarely written with a smaller character .
Even cipher crosswords have a Japanese equivalent , although pangrammaticity does not apply .
Crosswords with kanji to fill in are also produced , but in far smaller number as it takes far more effort to construct one .
Despite Japanese having three writing forms , hiragana , katakana and kanji , they are rarely mixed in a single crossword puzzle .
Prahlada Rao , based in Bangalore , has composed/ constructed some 35,000 crossword puzzles in the language Kannada , including 7,500 crosswords based on films made in Kannada , with a total of 10,00,000 ( ten lakhs , or one million ) clues .
His name has recorded in LIMCA BOOK OF RECORDS 2015 for creating highest crosswords in the Indian Regional Languages .
His name has continued in the LIMCA BOOK OF RECORDS 2016 and 2017 also .
A five volume set of his puzzles was released in February 2008 In 2013 two more crossword books released .
In 2017 his 5 Crossword Books published .
Bengali is also well known for its crossword puzzles .
Crosswords are published regularly in almost all the Bengali dailies and periodicals .
The grid system is quite similar to the British style and two-letter words are usually not allowed .
In Poland , crosswords typically use British-style grids , but some do not have shaded cells .
Shaded cells are often replaced by boxes with clues—such crosswords are called Swedish puzzles or Swedish-style crosswords .
In a vast majority of Polish crosswords , nouns are the only allowed words .
Swedish crosswords are mainly in the illustrated ( photos or drawings ) , in-line clue style typical of the Swedish-style grid mentioned above .
This tradition prospered already in the mid-1900s , in family magazines and sections of newspapers .
Then the specialised magazines took off .
Around the turn of the millennium , approximately half a dozen Swedish magazine publishers produced specialised crossword magazines , totaling more than twenty titles , often published on a monthly basis .
The oldest extant crossword magazine published in Swedish is Krysset ( from Bonnier ) , founded in 1957 .
Additionally , nearly all newspapers publish crosswords of some kind , and at weekends often devote specialised sections in the paper to crosswords and similar type of pastime material .
Both major evening dailies ( Aftonbladet and Expressen ) publish a weekly crossword supplement , named Kryss Quiz and Korsord respectively .
Both are available as paid supplements on Mondays and Tuesdays , as part of the ongoing competition between the two newspapers .
== Construction ==
=== American-style crosswords === In typical themed American-style crosswords , the theme is created first , as a set of symmetric long Across answers will be needed around which the grid can be created .
Since the grid will typically have 180-degree rotational symmetry , the answers will need to be also : thus a typical 15×15 square American puzzle might have two 15-letter entries and two 13-letter entries that could be arranged appropriately in the grid ( e.g. , one 15-letter entry in the third row , and the other symmetrically in the 13th row ; one 13-letter entry starting in the first square of the 6th row and the other ending in the last square of the 10th row ) .
The theme must not only be funny or interesting , but also internally consistent .
In the April 26 , 2005 by Sarah Keller mentioned above , the five themed entries contained in the different parts of a tree : SQUAREROOT , TABLELEAF , WARDROBETRUNK , BRAINSTEM , and BANKBRANCH .
In this puzzle , CHARTER OAK would not be an appropriate entry , as all the other entries contain different parts of a tree , not the name of a kind of tree .
Similarly , FAMILY TREE would not be appropriate unless it were used as a revealer for the theme ( frequently clued with a phrase along the lines and a hint to ) .
Given the existing entries , SEED MONEY would also be unacceptable , as all the other theme entries end in the part of a tree as opposed to beginning with it , though the puzzle could certainly be changed to have a mix of words in different positions.Once a consistent , appropriate theme has been chosen , a grid is designed around that theme , following a set of basic principles : Generally , most American puzzles are 15×15 squares ; if another size , they typically have an odd number of rows and columns : e.g. , 21×21 for Sunday-size puzzles ; GAMES Magazine will accept 17×17 puzzles , Simon Schuster accepts both 17×17 and 19×19 puzzles , and The New York Times requires diagramless puzzles to be 17×17 .
The odd number of squares on a side ensures that achieving symmetry is easier ; with even-numbered puzzles the central block of four squares makes constructing a symmetrical puzzle considerably more difficult .
The black squares must be arranged so as to ( 1 ) ensure there are no two-letter words ; ( 2 ) form 180-degree rotational symmetry ( so that if the grid is turned upside-down , the pattern of black squares remains the same ) ; ( 3 ) ensure that every letter is checked ( appears in both an Across and a Down word ) ; ( 4 ) not occupy too much of the puzzle ( generally speaking , 16 of the puzzle is considered a rough limit for the percentage of black squares ) ; ( 5 ) ensure that the entire puzzle has all-over interlock is , that the black squares do not cut the puzzle into separate sections ; and ( 6 ) ensure that ( generally ) no non-theme entry is longer than any of the theme entries .
In addition , it is considered advisable to minimize the number of so-called cheater black squares , i.e. , black squares whose removal would not change the word count of the puzzle but which make it easier to fill by shortening the length of the words therein .
The grid is then filled with suitable words , keeping in mind that ( 1 ) no word can be repeated in the grid ( with the exception of prepositions or articles ) ; ( 2 ) profanity or graphic or unpleasant words are generally not allowed ; ( 3 ) obscurity is strongly discouraged in easy puzzles and should be kept to a minimum in more difficult puzzles , where two obscure words should never be allowed to cross ( and , ideally , where the obscure word would be of interest to most solvers—a genus of little-known water bugs would not be a good choice ) ; ( 4 ) uncommon abbreviations and variant foreign spellings should be avoided , as well as the use of crosswordese ( those words that no longer appear in common speech but that occur frequently in crosswords due to their favorable letter combinations , such as the Asian buffalo ANOA ) ; ( 5 ) in modern puzzles , pop figures and corporate and brand names are generally considered acceptable ; ( 6 ) no made-up words are permitted—there should be a dictionary or other reference that can cite each entry if asked .
Modern constructors frequently ( although not always ) use software to speed the task .
Several programs are available , of which the most widely accepted is Crossword Compiler .
These programs , although they can not create themes and can not distinguish between good fill ( fun , interesting words dull obscurity ) , do speed up the process and will allow the constructor to realize if he or she has hit a dead end.Crossword puzzle payments for standard 15×15 puzzles from the major outlets range from 50 ( GAMES Magazine ) to 500 ( The New York Times ) while payments for 21×21 puzzles range from 150 ( Newsday ) to 1,500 ( The New York Times ) compensation structure of crosswords generally entails authors selling all rights to their puzzles upon publication , and as a result receiving no royalties from republication of their work in books or other forms .
This system has been criticized by American Values Club crossword editor Ben Tausig , among others .
== Software ==
Software that aids in creating crossword puzzles has been written since at least 1976 ; one popular example was Crossword Magic for the Apple II in the 1980s .
The earliest software relied on people to input a list of fill words and clues , and automatically maps the answers onto a suitable grid .
This is a search problem in computer science because there are many possible arrangements to be checked against the rules of construction .
Any given set of answers might have zero , one , or multiple legal arrangements .
Modern open source libraries exist that attempt to efficiently generate legal arrangements from a given set of answers.In the late 1990s , the transition began from mostly hand-created arrangements to computer-assisted , which creators generally say has allowed authors to produce more interesting and creative puzzles , reducing crosswordese.Modern software includes large databases of clues and answers , allowing the computer to randomly select words for the puzzle , potentially with guidance from the user as to the theme or a specific set of words to pick with greater probability .
Many serious users add words to the database as an expression of personal creativity or for use in a desired theme .
Software can also be used to assist the user in finding words for a specific spot in an arrangement by quickly searching through the dictionary for all words that fit .
== Notation ==
Originally Petherbridge called the two dimensions of the crossword puzzle Horizontal and Vertical .
Among various numbering schemes , the standard became that in which only the start squares of each word were numbered , from left to right and top to bottom .
1 Horizontal and 1 Vertical and the like were names for the clues , the cross words , or the grid locations , interchangeably .
Later in the Times these terms commonly became Across and Down and notations for clues could either use the words or the letters A and D , with or without hyphens .
