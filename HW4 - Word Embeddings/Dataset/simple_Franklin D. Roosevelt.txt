On December 8 , the United States Congress declared war on the Empire of Japan .
It was formulated an hour after the famous Infamy Speech by Roosevelt .
After the declaration , Japan 's allies , Germany and Italy , declared war on the United States .
This brought the United States fully into World War II .
The military used a draft to get people to fight the war , but many people in Puerto Rico , a colony of the United States , did not want to fight because they felt the U.S. was treating them badly by occupying the island .
The U.S. forced them to fight and to help pay for war supplies anyway.Roosevelt also signed an order allowing Japanese Americans to be sent to internment camps against their will .
While still president , he died on April 12 , 1945 .
Vice President Harry Truman became president .
World War II continued for almost four more months , but Allied victory was already assured .
For overcoming the difficult challenges of a depression and a world war , historians generally consider him to be one of the best U.S. presidents .
