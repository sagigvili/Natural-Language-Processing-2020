The Manhattan Project was the program based in the United States which tried to make the first nuclear weapons .
The project went on during World War II , and was run by the U.S. Army .
The head of the project was General Leslie Groves , who had led the building of the Pentagon .
The top scientist on the project was Robert Oppenheimer , a famous physicist .
The project cost 2 billion , and created many secret cities and bomb-making factories , such as a laboratory in Los Alamos , New Mexico , a nuclear reactor in Hanford , Washington , and a uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge , Tennessee .
The Manhattan Project had to find solutions to two difficulties .
The first difficulty is how to make the special isotopes of uranium ( uranium-235 ) or plutonium .
This process is called separation and is very slow .
The United States built very big buildings with three different kinds of machine for separation .
They made enough fissionable special isotopes for a few nuclear weapons .
The second difficulty was how to make a bomb that will produce a big nuclear explosion every time .
A weapon with a bad design can make a much smaller nuclear explosion .
This is called a fizzle .
In July 1945 , the Manhattan Project solved the two difficulties and made the first nuclear explosion .
This test of a nuclear weapon was called Trinity and was a success .
The Manhattan Project created two nuclear bombs which the United States used against Japan in 1945 .
== Espionage ==
The Manhattan Project operated under a blanket of tight security .
This was to prevent the Axis countries , especially Nazi Germany , from accelerating their own nuclear projects or undertaking covert operations against the project .
The possibility of sabotage was always present .
At times , people suspected sabotage when equipment failed .
While there were some problems believed to be the result of careless or disgruntled employees , there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage .
However , on 10 March 1945 , a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line , and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down.Maintaining security was difficult because so many people worked on the project .
A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment handled the project 's security issues .
By 1943 , it was clear that the Soviet Union was trying to penetrate the project .
Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash , the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command , investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley .
Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley , Haakon Chevalier , about passing information to the Soviet Union.The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs .
Fuchs was a member of the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos .
The 1950 revelation of Fuchs ' espionage activities damaged the United States ' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada .
Subsequently , other instances of espionage were uncovered , leading to the arrest of Harry Gold , David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg .
Other spies like George Koval remained unknown for decades .
People will never know the value of the espionage .
One reason was that the Soviet atomic bomb project was held back by a shortage of uranium ore .
The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort .
