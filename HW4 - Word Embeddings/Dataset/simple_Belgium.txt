== History ==
The name 'Belgium ' comes from Gallia Belgica .
This was a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul .
Before Roman invasion in 100 BC , the Belgae , a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples , lived there .
The Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings .
A slow shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to change into the Carolingian Empire .
The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and West Francia .
They were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor.Many of these fiefdoms were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries.The Eighty Years ' War ( 1568–1648 ) divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces and the Southern Netherlands .
Southern Netherlands were ruled by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs .
This made up most of modern Belgium .
After the campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars , the Low Countries were added into the French First Republic .
This ended Austrian rule in the area .
Adding back the Low Countries formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands .
This happened at the end of the First French Empire in 1815 .
The Belgian Revolution was in 1830 .
Leopold I became king on July 21 1831 .
This is now celebrated as Belgium 's National Day .
The Berlin Conference of 1885 gave control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II .
This was for him personally and not for the country of Belgium .
Millions of Congolese people were hurt or killed , mostly to make rubber , and Leopold became very wealthy .
In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony after there was a scandal about the deaths .
It was then called the Belgian Congo , but the indigenous peoples continued to be killed and face violence from the colonial government.Germany invaded Belgium in 1914 .
This was part of World War I .
The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium .
During the war Belgium took over the of Ruanda-Urundi ( modern-day Rwanda and Burundi ) .
After the First World War , the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were added into Belgium in 1925 .
The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 and under German control until 1944 .
After World War II , the people made king Leopold III leave his throne in 1951 .
This is because they thought he helped the Germans .
In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule .
Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free .
Belgium joined NATO as a founding member .
