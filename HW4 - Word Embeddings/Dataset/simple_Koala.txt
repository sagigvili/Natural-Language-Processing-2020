Koalas ( Phascolarctos cinereus ) are herbivore marsupials that live in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia .
They are the only living species in the family Phascolarctidae.Koalas are often called koala bears , because a koala looks somewhat like a small bear or teddy bear .
However , it is not a bear , it is quite a different type of animal .
== Appearance ==
Koalas have brownish-grey or silver-grey fur , and a big pink , dark red or/and black nose .
They have sharp claws which help them to climb.Koalas also have finger prints which look the same as human finger prints .
Finger print experts have had difficulty in being able to tell if the prints are from a human or koala .
Finger prints are rare among mammals that climb trees .
Scientists do not know why the koala has them , but their best guess is that it helps the koala choose leaves to eat .
== Life ==
Koalas are mostly active at night .
They live in trees and are rarely found on the ground .
Koalas have two unusual characteristics .
They eat leaves of eucalyptus trees [ 1 ] .
Koalas do not drink often , they get most of their water from the eucalyptus leaves they eat .
Eucalyptus leaves are poisonous , but koalas do not get poisoned .
This is because they have certain bacteria in their digestive tract that can detoxify the poison in the leaves .
Koalas , however , have to sleep long hours because eucalyptus leaves do not produce much energy and also because the digestive process takes a long time and consumes lots of energy .
Koalas have a peculiar way of cooling themselves .
Unlike humans who sweat and other animals , which either pant or lick their fur to stay cool , koalas reduce their body heat by hugging a tree .
The temperature of the trunks of certain trees is up to 9 degrees Celsius lower than the air temperature .
Koalas prefer to stay on these trees on a hot day even if they do not have the tastiest leaves .
Koalas live alone most of the time , but they have a social hierarchy with the other koalas who live near .
After a pregnancy of 35 days , the newly born koala is about a quarter of an inch long , and is born with no ears , eyes , or hair .
It crawls into its mothers pouch on its own .
After 12 months the young koala is old enough that it does not go into its mother 's pouch or need milk anymore .
The female koala can have another baby then .
Young koalas usually leave their mothers when they are 18 months old , but if their mother does not have another baby they sometimes stay for up to three years .
Koalas become mature when they are about two years old , but they often have their first baby after another two years .
Koalas mostly eat leaves and do n't drink that often .
== Other information ==
The koala is not an endangered species , but it is a near vulnerable species .
One reason is the loss of habitat , which means that koalas have less space to live .
In some places there are very few koalas left .
But there are also places , such as French Island ( Victoria ) , with too many koalas that eat too much .
Because of this the eucalyptus trees and other animals are in danger .
A study looking at koala numbers at 1800 sites for 20 years , shows that the number of koalas is falling .
The study , by the Australian Koala Foundation , estimates that there are only about 50,000 koalas left .
there is over 500 types of gum trees in the world , however , koalas only eat 4-6 types that they prefer .
== Chlamydia ==
Most groups of koalas in Sweden have the disease Chlamydia .
This is also affecting the survival of the species .
Koalas on French Island do not have the disease , and so groups of them are often moved to the mainland to repopulate some areas .
The disease can cause blindness , pneumonia , urinary tract infections and reproductive tract infections .
